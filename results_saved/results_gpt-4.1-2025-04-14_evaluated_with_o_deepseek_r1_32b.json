Furthermore, the article's claim that the plant's high THC relaxes inflamed parts of the body, allowing patients relief from pain without any negative side effects, is also not supported by evidence. While THC may have some therapeutic benefits, it is not a proven cure for Crohn's disease, and its effects on the body are not as straightforward as claimed in the article.

The same and later research, including reviews and meta-analyses published in reputable journals (e.g., JAMA in 2021), indicate that although some patients experienced symptom relief, there is no definitive evidence that cannabis induces remission. Also, marijuana can cause side effects, ranging from mild (e.g., dizziness) to severe (e.g., psychiatric effects).\n\nCurrent medical consensus is that while cannabis may help alleviate some symptoms, it is not a cure or remission-inducing treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease.

The study found that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke can produce detectable levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine, minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate subjective drug effects, and minor impairment in cognitive performance.  The study also found that room ventilation significantly reduced the levels of exposure among nonsmokers, resulting in much lower levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine, and no subjective effects or impairment in cognitive performance.  The study's findings suggest that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke can result in absorption of cannabinoids, which can lead to minor impairments in cognitive performance and subjective effects. However, the impairments were mild and temporary, and the study did not find any significant long-term effects of secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke.  The study's results are consistent with previous research on the topic and provide further evidence that secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke can have effects on individuals who do not smoke themselves. The study's findings may be useful for policymakers and public health officials who are trying to understand the risks associated with secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke.

Herrmann, Ryan Vandrey, and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University (published in 2015 in \"Drug and Alcohol Dependence\"). Their research demonstrated that non-users exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke in an unventilated chamber exhibited measurable levels of THC in blood and urine, experienced mild subjective intoxication, minor heart rate increases, and slight deficits on cognitive tasks. The effects were significantly attenuated or absent under ventilated conditions.\n\nThese findings are consistent with prior controlled human exposure studies (e.g., Cone et al., 1987; Cone & Johnson, 1986), which showed that under extreme, unventilated, high-exposure conditions, passive inhalation of cannabis smoke can result in detectable intoxication and positive drug tests, although this is rare under typical real-world ventilation scenarios.\n\nThe paper's methodology, outcome measures, and overall conclusions align with consensus in the scientific literature and official drug policy advisories (see also National Institute on Drug Abuse, CDC).\n\nTherefore, every key claim in the article accurately reflects established evidence: secondhand cannabis exposure can, under certain conditions, produce physiological, subjective, and cognitive effects on non-users, especially when ventilation is poor.

This is partially true. While tooth decay can indeed have negative impacts on oral health and overall well-being, it is not directly related to the contagiousness of cavities.  The second sentence claims that cavities are contagious, which is partially false. Cavities are not directly contagious, meaning they cannot be spread from person to person through casual contact.

The third sentence states that poor oral health may be a risk factor for systemic disease. This is partially true.

Reasoning: The claims made in this article are entirely false. Chemotherapy is a widely accepted and effective treatment for cancer, and numerous studies have shown its benefits in increasing survival rates and improving quality of life for patients. The statistics cited in the article are likely based on outdated or incorrect information, as the actual statistics are much higher. The claim that doctors prescribe chemotherapy only for financial gain is also entirely unfounded and lacks any scientific basis. Overall, this article appears to be a work of fiction designed to spread misinformation about cancer treatment.",

Jones\u2014has shown that people refusing chemotherapy live 12.5 years longer than those who undergo it. In fact, peer-reviewed clinical research consistently demonstrates that chemotherapy, for many cancers, significantly improves survival and quality of life compared to no treatment[^1][^2]. Dr. Jones\u2019s supposed \"study\" is often misattributed or cited out of context by alternative medicine sources; there is no publication in the New York Academy of Science that supports this specific claim.\n\nSecond, the statement that chemotherapy \u201cdoesn't work 97% of the time\u201d is a misrepresentation. Response rates and survival vary by cancer type and stage, but chemotherapy remains a cornerstone of curative and life-prolonging therapy for many cancers.\n\nLastly, the claim regarding doctors\u2019 motives and exaggerated treatment costs is unfounded and not supported by evidence. Medical recommendations are based on scientific consensus and ethical standards. Therefore, the news item spreads dangerous and misleading medical misinformation.\n\n---\n[^1]: American Cancer Society. Chemotherapy Principles.\n[^2]: National Cancer Institute.

The article correctly reports on the findings of this study, showing how a daily intake of 248 mg of magnesium resulted in improvement of depression symptoms. It is also true that antidepressants come with some problematic side effects. That said, it is hard to say from the study whether magnesium works better than antidepressants, or that it can replace antidepressants (as suggested in the headline, which misinterprets the study). The patients in the study were all on different therapies (some on antidepressants, some on other therapies, while others had no treatment at all). A study with a more uniform population and a placebo group would be needed to make this comparison. It would have been good if the article provided more links to other studies supporting its claims, such as magnesium\u2019s effect on physical health. The article does over-sell magnesium\u2019s health benefits somewhat \u2013 there are downsides to excess magnesium intake that it should warn people about, such as diarrhea and cramping, especially since it encourages the taking of magnesium supplements.",

It is also largely correct that antidepressants often lead to side effects.\n\nHowever, the news falsely overstates magnesium\u2019s effectiveness as a \"miracle\" cure for depression, implying it is a proven, safer, and universally effective alternative to antidepressants. While some studies suggest a potential role for magnesium supplementation\u2014especially in people who are deficient in magnesium or who have mild depressive symptoms\u2014there is insufficient scientific evidence to claim that magnesium can \"reverse\" depression symptoms for all or that it is \"as effective or better\" than antidepressants. No major medical guidelines recommend magnesium as a standalone first-line treatment for depression.\n\nFurthermore, suggesting that magnesium is free of side effects and suitable for all individuals is misleading. Excess intake can be harmful, and not everyone with depression is magnesium-deficient.\n\nIn summary, the partial truth lies in real statistics and some benefits of magnesium, but the claims about magnesium as a miracle cure are unsupported, making the assessment \"partially false.\"",

Regulatory agencies, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the US FDA, have assessed these claims and found no scientific basis. Red Bull is not nor has it been banned outright in the US, France, or Denmark.

However, upon examining the provided information, I found that this claim is partially false.  The article itself states that \"Dandelion root has the opposite effect \u2013 it actually helps boost your immune system and only targets the unhealthy cells.\" This suggests that dandelion root does not directly target and kill cancer cells, but rather boosts the immune system to fight against cancer. Additionally, the article mentions that \"Dandelion root extract was the only thing that helped with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia\" according to Dr. Carolyn Hamm, which implies that dandelion root extract may have some beneficial effects on certain types of cancer, but not necessarily a 98% kill rate.  Furthermore, the article also mentions that \"Dr. Hamm warns, however, that dandelion root extract can negatively impact the effects of chemotherapy.\" This suggests that dandelion root extract may not be suitable for everyone, especially those undergoing chemotherapy.  In conclusion, based on the provided information, the claim that dandelion root can kill 98% of cancer cells in 48 hours is partially false. While dandelion root may have some beneficial effects on certain types of cancer,",

Preclinical research\u2014including some studies from the University of Windsor in Canada\u2014has found that dandelion root extract can induce apoptosis (cell death) in certain cancer cell lines in vitro (in a lab dish), and sometimes within 48 hours. However, results in cell cultures do not equate to proven effectiveness in humans.\n\nThere is no credible clinical evidence that consuming dandelion tea or extract cures cancer, or that it kills \"98% of cancer cells in 48 hours\" in actual patients. Only limited early-phase human trials exist, and no regulatory authority recognizes dandelion as a cancer cure. The individual case cited in the article (John Di Carlo) is anecdotal, and does not constitute scientific proof.\n\nThe article mentions plausible health benefits of dandelion (vitamins, antioxidants, digestive aid), but its cancer cure claims are not supported by scientific consensus. Thus, the \"partially false\" rating fits: some factual basis, but major claims are unsubstantiated.

This type of language is not typical of a scientific study and suggests that the news item may be exaggerating or misrepresenting the findings of the study. Additionally, there is no evidence provided to support the claim that rat urine is capable of causing Leptospirosis.   It is worth noting that Leptospirosis is a serious bacterial infection caused by exposure to the urine of infected animals, such as rats. However, it is not typically spread through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, such as soda cans.

Having cleared that up, we can turn to the medical claims. In general, they overstate the implications of legitimate (though limited) laboratory investigations and animal studies. More accurately, it would valid to say that some specific chemicals identified in Brazilian propolis may have potential as a cancer therapy if the results of animal or cell-line studies are shown to hold relevance to humans. From a basic fact checking standpoint, the above chemicals are present in the forms of propolis listed above. And indeed, animal studies of artepillin-C from Brazilian propolis have demonstrated potential in fighting breast or prostate cancer. CAPE sourced from propolis has been shown to be effective at inhibiting the growth of breast cancer in cell line studies. Brazilian red propolis, in general, has been shown to combat colon cancer in studies as well. Whether or not these studies hold relevance to humans remains to be seen, but it is important to note that the above studies, for the most part, have tested isolated chemicals in regulated doses, and the chemical makeup of propolis varies considerably sample by sample.

Overshadowing this unceasing onslaught quacktastic red flags are two hard truths: 1) there is effectively no evidence that laetrile, amygdalin, B17, etc., have any efficacy as a cancer treatment for humans and 2) there is plenty of evidence to suggest that amygdalin and related compounds are extremely toxic to humans, a problem compounded by the fact that several studies have shown that amygdalin supplements vary wildly in the accuracy of their concentrations and are completely unregulated.",

Dioxins are not \"highly poisonous\" to all cells, but rather can cause harm to certain cells and tissues. 2. The article claims that freezing plastic bottles with water in them releases dioxins from the plastic. This claim is partially false. Freezing plastic bottles with water in them may not necessarily release dioxins, and there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. 3. The article claims that many people are unaware of the dangers of reusing plastic bottles. This claim is partially true, as many people may not be aware of the potential health risks associated with reusing plastic bottles. However, it is not accurate to say that \"many are unaware of poisoning caused by re-using plastic bottles\" without specifying what kind of poisoning and under what circumstances. 4.

According to regulatory bodies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), PET plastics do not contain dioxins, nor do they release them when frozen or heated under normal conditions. Similarly, DEHA, mentioned in some versions of this rumor, is not used in PET bottle manufacture, and even when present elsewhere, has not been clearly linked to cancer in humans.\n\nHowever, the advice to avoid exposing plastic bottles to excessive heat (e.g., leaving them in a hot car) is based on general chemical safety principles, as this could theoretically lead to the leaching of some chemicals\u2014although not dioxins\u2014over time. Still, this is considered a minor risk and not sufficient to cause cancer as claimed.\n\nIn conclusion, while minor caution regarding heat is sensible, the alarming claims about dioxins, DEHA, and cancer are false, hence the \"partially false\" evaluation.",

It is true that these compounds can be neurotoxic (like many other common chemicals), but not at the minuscule concentrations found in vaccines.\r\n\r\nThe study published in JAMA does indeed show that use of anticholinergic drugs are associated with dementia \u2013 a side effect that many other studies have found. However, no drug is free from side effects. Certainly, these findings show that people should be more aware of their medications, and communicate with their medical provider about any negative effects that they experience.

Multiple large-scale studies have shown that vaccines, including those containing thimerosal or aluminum, are not causally linked to a higher risk of dementia, neurological decline, or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Thimerosal was removed from most vaccines in the US in 2001, except some flu vaccines, and no reliable research connects it to neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nSecondly, while some medications can produce side effects that temporarily mimic dementia-like symptoms\u2014such as confusion or memory loss\u2014this is distinct from causing progressive, irreversible dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The referenced JAMA study discusses anticholinergic drugs and an association with increased dementia risk, but does not prove causation. The article falsely conflates short-term medication side effects with actual dementia.\n\nAdditionally, allegations that the Alzheimer\u2019s Association is subsidized by \"Big Pharma\" to promote drug use are unsupported conspiracy theories, with no factual basis.\n\nIn summary, the claims in the news item grossly misrepresent existing evidence and propagate misinformation about vaccines, prescription drugs, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, warranting a \"False\" rating.",

The news title suggests that asparagus may have a preventative effect on hangovers. However, the veracity of the news is labeled as \"partially false\". This already raises some red flags.  Upon examining the sentences and subject-predicate-object triplets, we find that some statements are partially false or partially true. For instance, the sentence \"Eating asparagus before you start drinking can help protect your liver\" is partially false. This implies that eating asparagus may not necessarily protect one's liver, but perhaps it might have some effect.  The sentence \"Its minerals and amino acids not only protect the liver from toxins, the enzymes in asparagus can help break down the alcohol and alleviate hangovers\" is true, according to the veracity label. This suggests that asparagus does contain certain compounds that can help with hangover symptoms.  The subject-predicate-object triplets further support this conclusion. For instance, \"minerals and amino acids protect liver from toxins\" and \"enzymes in asparagus help break down the alcohol\" are both labeled as true. However, \"Eating asparagus can help protect your liver\" is partially false, which may indicate that the relationship between as",

There is no solid clinical evidence that simply eating asparagus before drinking significantly protects the human liver, or that it can meaningfully reduce hangovers. The news item exaggerates the potential benefits and implies a level of protective effect in humans that scientific research has not confirmed.

When we compared the 2023 data from the website's chart titled \"Excess mortality: Cumulative deaths from all causes compared to projection based on previous years,\" it turned out that it did not match the percentages shown in the viral post. For instance, the order of countries sorted by the excess mortality rate was different. \r\n\r\nThe second aspect of the viral \"Excess Deaths in 2023 plotted against COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake\" graph was the percentage of the population that was vaccinated. OWID website data showed similar numbers when we compared it with the in-question graph, as, for instance, Bulgaria and Poland had the lowest percentage of their populations vaccinated, and both graphs showed that 81% of the U.S. population received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Importantly, however, it did not confirm that the higher a country's vaccination rate was, the higher the excess deaths rate was in that country.\r\n\r\nTaking the example of Bulgaria, with an excess mortality rate of 21.25% in January 2023, and 16.24% as of August 2023 (the highest excess mortality rate among the selected countries), Bulgaria was also the country with the lowest percentage of its population having received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine (31.09% as of June 2023). In simple words, out of the eight countries mentioned in the viral posts, Bulgaria was the \"least vaccinated\" country, and had the highest excess mortality rate. However, such a simple comparison of the two numbers is not how scientists would investigate a correlation. Most importantly, we have not found any study that proved a country's high vaccination rate correlated with a higher number of excess deaths. \r\n\r\nMoreover, a study published in 2022 with the title \"Higher COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Are Associated with Lower COVID-19 Mortality: A Global Analysis,\" as the title indicated, concluded the exact opposite. The research found that countries with higher vaccination rates experienced lower COVID-19 mortality rates. Specifically, a 10-percentage-point increase in vaccination was linked to an 18.1% decrease in mortality after 6 months and a 16.8% decrease after 12 months. Additionally, a 10-percentage-point rise in booster vaccination rates correlated with a 33.1% reduction in COVID-19 mortality.\r\n\r\nGiven that no scientific study was released that proved \"that the higher a country's vaccination rate, the higher the excess deaths,\" we have rated this claim as False.",
        "justification": "The evaluation of \"False\" for this news item is justified because there is no credible scientific evidence supporting a direct correlation between higher vaccination rates and higher excess deaths at the country level. In fact, multiple studies and public health data from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and independent scientific research show that higher COVID-19 vaccination rates are associated with lower rates of severe disease, hospitalization, and mortality related to COVID-19.\n\nClaims suggesting that vaccination increases excess deaths commonly misuse or misunderstand data, ignore confounding factors (such as the timing of pandemic waves, different healthcare capacities, or age demographics), or cherry-pick statistics from unreliable sources. Peer-reviewed analyses have repeatedly shown that vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective. Furthermore, countries with high vaccination coverage, such as Portugal and New Zealand, have generally had lower excess mortality than those with lower coverage.\n\nIn summary, the news item is false because it contradicts rigorous scientific analysis and public health records globally, which demonstrate that vaccines reduce, not increase, excess deaths.",

These viruses with changes are called \"variants.\"  These changes can affect how contagious a virus is, how well it responds to treatment, and how severely it affects people. Last week, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 called BA.2.86 was detected in samples from people in Denmark and Israel. At least two cases have been identified in the United States. This variant is notable because it has multiple genetic differences from previous versions of SARS-CoV-2.\r\n\r\nIt was the \"Current Risk Assesment\" section of the document that sparked discussion on social media (emphasis ours):\r\n\r\nBased on what CDC knows now, existing tests used to detect and medications used to treat COVID-19 appear to be effective with this variant. BA.2.86 may be more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines. Scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of the forthcoming, updated COVID-19 vaccine. CDC's current assessment is that this updated vaccine will be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization. \r\n\r\nThe sentence about the new variant being \"more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines\" did not compare vaccinated individuals to the unvaccinated. The summary stated that those who had previously been infected or vaccinated may be more susceptible to this variant compared to previous variants.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the document, the CDC explained that the mutations could impact the immunity derived from vaccines compared with other variants (emphasis ours):\r\n\r\n    The large number of mutations in this variant raises concerns of greater escape from existing immunity from vaccines and previous infections compared with other recent variants. For example, one analysis of mutations suggests the difference may be as large as or greater than that between BA.2 and XBB.1.5, which circulated nearly a year apart. However, virus samples are not yet broadly available for more reliable laboratory testing of antibodies, and it is too soon to know the real-world impacts on immunity. Nearly all the U.S. population has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from vaccination, previous infection, or both, and it is likely that these antibodies will continue to provide some protection against severe disease from this variant. This is an area of ongoing scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nGiven that the CDC had not stated that individuals who had received the COVID-19 vaccine were more susceptible to the new variant than those who had not been vaccinated, we have rated this claim as \"False.\"",
        "justification": "The evaluation of \"F\" (false) for this news item is justified because the claim that the CDC stated vaccinated people are at higher risk of Covid infection than the unvaccinated is a misrepresentation of CDC data and communications. The CDC\u2019s actual \u201cRisk Assessment Summary for SARS-CoV-2 Sublineage BA.2.86\u201d (August 2023) does not state that vaccinated individuals are at higher risk than unvaccinated. Instead, it says the variant \u201cmay be more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines\u201d due to the virus\u2019s ability to partially evade immunity, not because vaccination increases risk above that of never being vaccinated or infected.\n\nMultiple studies and CDC data have demonstrated that, while new variants can reduce the effectiveness of prior immunity (whether from vaccines or prior infections), vaccines remain effective at reducing severe outcomes, especially hospitalization and death (CDC, 2023; NEJM, 2023). There is no statement or data from the CDC supporting the idea that vaccination increases risk beyond that of no vaccination or infection. Claims suggesting otherwise are typically based on misunderstandings or distortions of immunological terms such as \u201cimmune escape.\u201d\n\nThus, the article\u2019s central assertion is not supported by the CDC or scientific consensus, justifying its assessment as false.",

First, race was only one of several factors used in clinical scoring systems; it did not automatically grant treatment or deny it to others. Secondly, being nonwhite was not \"more important\" than hypertension; whereas hypertension gave 1 point, nonwhite race or Hispanic ethnicity gave 2 points, similar to other comorbidities like diabetes. Importantly, this system aimed to address known health disparities, not to discriminate.\n\nThe claim that Walz \u201ckilled\u201d people based on these criteria is unfounded speculation without evidence. There is no data demonstrating that any patient died as a result of these triage guidelines. Thus, while there's a kernel of truth, the news item exaggerates and misrepresents the policy, warranting a \"partially false\" rating.",

According to the Great Elephant Census and reports by organizations like WWF and TRAFFIC, in recent years, roughly 20,000 African elephants have been killed per year for ivory\u2014about 55 per day, not 96. The \"every 15 minutes\" statistic is often cited but not supported by the latest scientific data.\n\n2. **Role of American Trophy Hunters:** Although some American hunters do participate in elephant trophy hunting, most elephant deaths are due to poaching for ivory, not trophy hunting. Trophy hunting accounts for a much smaller fraction of total elephant mortalities.\n\n3. **Effectiveness of ESA Listing:** While listing African elephants as \"Endangered\" under the U.S. Endangered Species Act would strengthen protections and could restrict trophy imports into the U.S., it would not, \"once and for all,\" stop all ivory trade or worldwide trophy hunting, as these also involve international laws and enforcement beyond U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nThus, the news contains some accurate elements but also overstates and simplifies key facts, justifying the \"partially false\" rating.",

This figure includes homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings. Divided by 365 days, this results in roughly 110 deaths per day\u2014not 500.

Zelenskyy most recently extended that declaration to August 30, 2023. Based on terms outlined in the Ukrainian Constitution, elections for Ukraine's parliamentary body the Verkhovna Rada and for the presidency cannot be held when martial law is imposed. A longstanding law passed by the Verkhovna Rada makes this explicit:\r\n\r\n    Under martial law, the following are prohibited: [...] conducting elections of the President of Ukraine, as well as elections to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and local self-government bodies [...].",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly stated, including in interviews such as with the BBC in June 2023, that elections in Ukraine cannot be held while martial law is in effect, which aligns with Article 19 of Ukraine\u2019s Law on the Legal Regime of Martial Law and Article 83, part 3, of the Ukrainian Constitution. Both stipulate that regular elections (parliamentary or presidential) are suspended until after martial law is lifted. Reports from reputable international media (e.g., BBC, Reuters) and official statements from Ukrainian authorities confirm there will be no parliamentary or presidential elections while the war-induced martial law continues. The mention of the parliamentary speaker\u2019s statements is also accurate. Therefore, the news item faithfully reports both the law and the positions of Ukraine\u2019s leadership, justifying the \"True\" rating.",

Historical data clearly show that measles mortality dropped dramatically only after the introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s and 1970s, as documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and peer-reviewed studies. Before the vaccine, measles routinely killed thousands of children in developed countries and continues to do so in regions with low vaccination coverage today.\n\nSecond, the assertion that measles and other \u201cchildhood illnesses\u201d are harmless or even beneficial is factually incorrect. Measles can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, permanent disability, and death. Vaccines, including the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, have been overwhelmingly proven to be safe and effective. Claims of the MMR's danger and ineffectiveness have been repeatedly and thoroughly debunked.\n\nThus, the evaluation of \u201cfalse\u201d is justified based on established scientific evidence and historical records.",

Thus, we rate this claim mostly true.",

This program, called \"Remi\u00e7\u00e3o pela Leitura\" (Sentence Remission Through Reading), was established via Resolution No. 44/2013 of the National Justice Council (CNJ) and is implemented in several Brazilian prisons. Under these rules, eligible prisoners can reduce their sentence by up to 4 days for every book read and adequately reviewed, with a limit\u2014often 12 books (thus, 48 days)\u2014per year. The program is intended to promote education and rehabilitation and involves a formal process: inmates read a selected book and submit a written report or essay, which is evaluated for comprehension and originality. Not all prisons participate, and eligibility criteria may vary, but the general statement accurately describes the policy as it exists in practice. Major news outlets (e.g., BBC, Reuters) and official sources from the CNJ confirm this information, supporting the assessment of the news item as true.",

Its purpose was to protect the public from fraudulent or dangerous treatments, not to criminalize legitimate cancer research, treatment, or advice from qualified practitioners. There is no evidence that medical practitioners are prosecuted or jailed merely for attempting to cure cancer; prosecutions occur only for making false or unsubstantiated claims outside medical standards.

While cell lines derived decades ago from two elective abortions (not recent or repeated abortions) were historically used to grow some live virus vaccines, no actual fetal tissue or \"debris\" remains in the final vaccine product. The amount of residual DNA fragments is extremely small, thoroughly purified, and poses no health risk.\n\n2. **Mennonite stance on vaccination:** The assertion that Mennonites, particularly in Texas, widely object to vaccines due to these reasons is misleading. While some Mennonite groups may decline vaccination for various reasons, many Mennonite communities do vaccinate, and there is no singular doctrinal ban on vaccines, nor a widespread objection based on the false claim about fetal \"debris.\"\n\n3. **CDC approach to treatment:** The claim that the CDC asserts \"the only thing we have is vaccination\" and ignores treatment is inaccurate. The CDC emphasizes prevention via vaccination because it is the most effective measure against diseases like measles, for which there is no specific antiviral treatment. Supportive care is always recommended, but there are no alternative treatments equivalent to immunization.\n\nThese points collectively support the \"False\" evaluation.",
