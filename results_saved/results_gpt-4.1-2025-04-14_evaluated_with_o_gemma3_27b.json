The article itself states that the 2013 study found that medical marijuana quieted symptoms in most participants and contributed to complete remission in about half of the participants, but it does not claim that it leads to complete remission. Additionally, the other sentences in the article are also labeled as \"false\", indicating that they are not supported by evidence.  Furthermore, the article's claim that the plant's high THC relaxes inflamed parts of the body, allowing patients relief from pain without any negative side effects, is also not supported by evidence. While THC may have some therapeutic benefits, it is not a proven cure for Crohn's disease, and its effects on the body are not as straightforward as claimed in the article.

While the study\u2019s abstract notes that 5 of 11 patients in the cannabis group achieved remission compared to 1 of 10 in the placebo group, the results were not statistically significant for the primary endpoint, and the sample size was extremely small.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that marijuana leads to \u201ccomplete remission\u201d with no side effects is false. The same and later research, including reviews and meta-analyses published in reputable journals (e.g., JAMA in 2021), indicate that although some patients experienced symptom relief, there is no definitive evidence that cannabis induces remission. Also, marijuana can cause side effects, ranging from mild (e.g., dizziness) to severe (e.g., psychiatric effects).\n\nCurrent medical consensus is that while cannabis may help alleviate some symptoms, it is not a cure or remission-inducing treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease.

        "original_reasoning_text": "The news item appears to be a scientific study about the effects of secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke on individuals who do not smoke cannabis themselves. The study found that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke can produce detectable levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine, minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate subjective drug effects, and minor impairment in cognitive performance.  The study also found that room ventilation significantly reduced the levels of exposure among nonsmokers, resulting in much lower levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine, and no subjective effects or impairment in cognitive performance.  The study's findings suggest that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke can result in absorption of cannabinoids, which can lead to minor impairments in cognitive performance and subjective effects. However, the impairments were mild and temporary, and the study did not find any significant long-term effects of secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke.  The study's results are consistent with previous research on the topic and provide further evidence that secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke can have effects on individuals who do not smoke themselves. The study's findings may be useful for policymakers and public health officials who are trying to understand the risks associated with secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke.  Overall, the veracity of this news item is \"true\" because it is based on a scientific study",
        "justification": "The evaluation of \u201cTrue\u201d (T) for this news item is well justified based on the current body of scientific research and authoritative sources.\n\nThe study described in the article closely matches a well-cited, peer-reviewed investigation led by Evan S. Herrmann, Ryan Vandrey, and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University (published in 2015 in \"Drug and Alcohol Dependence\"). Their research demonstrated that non-users exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke in an unventilated chamber exhibited measurable levels of THC in blood and urine, experienced mild subjective intoxication, minor heart rate increases, and slight deficits on cognitive tasks. The effects were significantly attenuated or absent under ventilated conditions.\n\nThese findings are consistent with prior controlled human exposure studies (e.g., Cone et al., 1987; Cone & Johnson, 1986), which showed that under extreme, unventilated, high-exposure conditions, passive inhalation of cannabis smoke can result in detectable intoxication and positive drug tests, although this is rare under typical real-world ventilation scenarios.\n\nThe paper's methodology, outcome measures, and overall conclusions align with consensus in the scientific literature and official drug policy advisories (see also National Institute on Drug Abuse, CDC).\n\nTherefore, every key claim in the article accurately reflects established evidence: secondhand cannabis exposure can, under certain conditions, produce physiological, subjective, and cognitive effects on non-users, especially when ventilation is poor. Room ventilation mitigates these risks.",

The first sentence, according to Liliana Rozo, D.D.S., assistant professor at the University of Louisville School of Dentistry, states that tooth decay can have a detrimental effect on a child's quality of life, performance in school, and success in life. This is partially true. While tooth decay can indeed have negative impacts on oral health and overall well-being, it is not directly related to the contagiousness of cavities.  The second sentence claims that cavities are contagious, which is partially false. Cavities are not directly contagious, meaning they cannot be spread from person to person through casual contact. However, oral bacteria can be transmitted through various means such as poor oral hygiene, sharing food and drinks, or contaminated surfaces.  The third sentence states that poor oral health may be a risk factor for systemic disease. This is partially true.

For instance, while tooth decay can impact a child\u2019s quality of life, performance in school, and social development, direct causality between caries and \"success in life\" or systemic diseases like heart disease is unproven or only weakly supported in children. Scientific evidence linking poor childhood oral health directly as a risk for systemic diseases primarily comes from studies in adults and is less definitive for children. Claims regarding oral health's impact on systemic diseases in children are therefore overstated.\n\nTherefore, while the core facts are correct, the article includes some exaggerations and generalizations, justifying the \"partially false\" rating.",

While bromelain does have anti-inflammatory properties, its effectiveness in treating various health conditions is still a topic of ongoing research and debate. 4.

However, upon examining the provided information, I found that this claim is partially false.  The article itself states that \"Dandelion root has the opposite effect \u2013 it actually helps boost your immune system and only targets the unhealthy cells.\" This suggests that dandelion root does not directly target and kill cancer cells, but rather boosts the immune system to fight against cancer. Additionally, the article mentions that \"Dandelion root extract was the only thing that helped with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia\" according to Dr. Carolyn Hamm, which implies that dandelion root extract may have some beneficial effects on certain types of cancer, but not necessarily a 98% kill rate.  Furthermore, the article also mentions that \"Dr. Hamm warns, however, that dandelion root extract can negatively impact the effects of chemotherapy.\" This suggests that dandelion root extract may not be suitable for everyone, especially those undergoing chemotherapy.  In conclusion, based on the provided information, the claim that dandelion root can kill 98% of cancer cells in 48 hours is partially false.

From a basic fact checking standpoint, the above chemicals are present in the forms of propolis listed above. And indeed, animal studies of artepillin-C from Brazilian propolis have demonstrated potential in fighting breast or prostate cancer. CAPE sourced from propolis has been shown to be effective at inhibiting the growth of breast cancer in cell line studies. Brazilian red propolis, in general, has been shown to combat colon cancer in studies as well. Whether or not these studies hold relevance to humans remains to be seen, but it is important to note that the above studies, for the most part, have tested isolated chemicals in regulated doses, and the chemical makeup of propolis varies considerably sample by sample.

No official pharmacopoeia lists it as a vitamin, and it does not possess any of the required characteristics of a vitamin. Amygdalin is a naturally occurring compound that can be found in a variety of foods, most notably bitter almonds and the pits of apricots and other fruits.

Overshadowing this unceasing onslaught quacktastic red flags are two hard truths: 1) there is effectively no evidence that laetrile, amygdalin, B17, etc., have any efficacy as a cancer treatment for humans and 2) there is plenty of evidence to suggest that amygdalin and related compounds are extremely toxic to humans, a problem compounded by the fact that several studies have shown that amygdalin supplements vary wildly in the accuracy of their concentrations and are completely unregulated.",

There have been claims\u2014mostly from the 1950s and 1970s, notably around the substance \u201claetrile\u201d\u2014that amygdalin can cure cancer, but extensive scientific reviews (e.g., from the US National Cancer Institute and the European Food Safety Authority) have found no credible evidence supporting this, and many studies have shown it is ineffective and potentially dangerous due to cyanide poisoning risk.\n\nCancer is a complex group of diseases caused by genetic mutations and environmental factors, not a simple nutritional deficiency.

The article claims that dioxins are \"highly poisonous to the cells of our bodies.\" While it is true that dioxins are toxic and can cause health problems, the statement is an exaggeration. Dioxins are not \"highly poisonous\" to all cells, but rather can cause harm to certain cells and tissues. 2. The article claims that freezing plastic bottles with water in them releases dioxins from the plastic. This claim is partially false. Freezing plastic bottles with water in them may not necessarily release dioxins, and there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. 3. The article claims that many people are unaware of the dangers of reusing plastic bottles.

        "justification": "The evaluation as \"partially false\" (PF) for this news item is justified because the claims mix some accurate concerns with significant misinformation. \n\nFirstly, the core assertion\u2014that freezing or heating plastic water bottles (usually made from PET) releases dangerous levels of dioxins or DEHA into the water, thus causing cancer\u2014is not supported by scientific evidence. According to regulatory bodies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), PET plastics do not contain dioxins, nor do they release them when frozen or heated under normal conditions. Similarly, DEHA, mentioned in some versions of this rumor, is not used in PET bottle manufacture, and even when present elsewhere, has not been clearly linked to cancer in humans.\n\nHowever, the advice to avoid exposing plastic bottles to excessive heat (e.g., leaving them in a hot car) is based on general chemical safety principles, as this could theoretically lead to the leaching of some chemicals\u2014although not dioxins\u2014over time. Still, this is considered a minor risk and not sufficient to cause cancer as claimed.\n\nIn conclusion, while minor caution regarding heat is sensible, the alarming claims about dioxins, DEHA, and cancer are false, hence the \"partially false\" evaluation.",

The article accurately reports on findings from a 2021 study published in Nature Communications (Sabia et al., 2021), which followed nearly 8,000 British adults over 25 years. The study indeed found that individuals who consistently slept six hours or less per night in their 50s and 60s had a higher risk of developing dementia compared to those who slept seven hours. The methodology\u2014using both self-reported and device-verified sleep measures\u2014was robust. The researchers controlled for other factors such as cardiometabolic and mental health conditions, further strengthening the association. \n\nIt is correctly stated that causation was not proven, but an association was found. This nuance is present in the news item. Key health organizations, like the World Health Organization and Alzheimer\u2019s Society, also acknowledge the link between poor sleep and dementia risk, while emphasizing that more research is needed to prove causality. \n\nOverall, the news item is an accurate reflection of current scientific understanding and appropriately reports the limitations, supporting the \"true\" rating. \n\n**Sources:**\n- Sabia, S. et al.

The news title suggests that asparagus may have a preventative effect on hangovers. However, the veracity of the news is labeled as \"partially false\". This already raises some red flags.  Upon examining the sentences and subject-predicate-object triplets, we find that some statements are partially false or partially true. For instance, the sentence \"Eating asparagus before you start drinking can help protect your liver\" is partially false. This implies that eating asparagus may not necessarily protect one's liver, but perhaps it might have some effect.  The sentence \"Its minerals and amino acids not only protect the liver from toxins, the enzymes in asparagus can help break down the alcohol and alleviate hangovers\" is true, according to the veracity label. This suggests that asparagus does contain certain compounds that can help with hangover symptoms.  The subject-predicate-object triplets further support this conclusion.

There is no solid clinical evidence that simply eating asparagus before drinking significantly protects the human liver, or that it can meaningfully reduce hangovers.

When we compared the 2023 data from the website's chart titled \"Excess mortality: Cumulative deaths from all causes compared to projection based on previous years,\" it turned out that it did not match the percentages shown in the viral post. For instance, the order of countries sorted by the excess mortality rate was different. \r\n\r\nThe second aspect of the viral \"Excess Deaths in 2023 plotted against COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake\" graph was the percentage of the population that was vaccinated. OWID website data showed similar numbers when we compared it with the in-question graph, as, for instance, Bulgaria and Poland had the lowest percentage of their populations vaccinated, and both graphs showed that 81% of the U.S. population received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Importantly, however, it did not confirm that the higher a country's vaccination rate was, the higher the excess deaths rate was in that country.\r\n\r\nTaking the example of Bulgaria, with an excess mortality rate of 21.25% in January 2023, and 16.24% as of August 2023 (the highest excess mortality rate among the selected countries), Bulgaria was also the country with the lowest percentage of its population having received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine (31.09% as of June 2023). In simple words, out of the eight countries mentioned in the viral posts, Bulgaria was the \"least vaccinated\" country, and had the highest excess mortality rate. However, such a simple comparison of the two numbers is not how scientists would investigate a correlation. Most importantly, we have not found any study that proved a country's high vaccination rate correlated with a higher number of excess deaths. \r\n\r\nMoreover, a study published in 2022 with the title \"Higher COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Are Associated with Lower COVID-19 Mortality: A Global Analysis,\" as the title indicated, concluded the exact opposite. The research found that countries with higher vaccination rates experienced lower COVID-19 mortality rates. Specifically, a 10-percentage-point increase in vaccination was linked to an 18.1% decrease in mortality after 6 months and a 16.8% decrease after 12 months. Additionally, a 10-percentage-point rise in booster vaccination rates correlated with a 33.1% reduction in COVID-19 mortality.\r\n\r\nGiven that no scientific study was released that proved \"that the higher a country's vaccination rate, the higher the excess deaths,\" we have rated this claim as False.",

Peer-reviewed analyses have repeatedly shown that vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective. Furthermore, countries with high vaccination coverage, such as Portugal and New Zealand, have generally had lower excess mortality than those with lower coverage.\n\nIn summary, the news item is false because it contradicts rigorous scientific analysis and public health records globally, which demonstrate that vaccines reduce, not increase, excess deaths.",

        "item_class": "F",
        "original_reasoning_text": "The rumor emerged after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a \"Risk Assessment Summary for SARS CoV-2 Sublineage BA.2.86\" on Aug. 23, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the summary explained what variants of viruses are with regard to a new one identified in several countries the previous week:\r\n\r\nAll viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), change over time. These viruses with changes are called \"variants.\"  These changes can affect how contagious a virus is, how well it responds to treatment, and how severely it affects people. Last week, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 called BA.2.86 was detected in samples from people in Denmark and Israel. At least two cases have been identified in the United States. This variant is notable because it has multiple genetic differences from previous versions of SARS-CoV-2.\r\n\r\nIt was the \"Current Risk Assesment\" section of the document that sparked discussion on social media (emphasis ours):\r\n\r\nBased on what CDC knows now, existing tests used to detect and medications used to treat COVID-19 appear to be effective with this variant. BA.2.86 may be more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines. Scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of the forthcoming, updated COVID-19 vaccine. CDC's current assessment is that this updated vaccine will be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization. \r\n\r\nThe sentence about the new variant being \"more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines\" did not compare vaccinated individuals to the unvaccinated. The summary stated that those who had previously been infected or vaccinated may be more susceptible to this variant compared to previous variants.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the document, the CDC explained that the mutations could impact the immunity derived from vaccines compared with other variants (emphasis ours):\r\n\r\n    The large number of mutations in this variant raises concerns of greater escape from existing immunity from vaccines and previous infections compared with other recent variants. For example, one analysis of mutations suggests the difference may be as large as or greater than that between BA.2 and XBB.1.5, which circulated nearly a year apart. However, virus samples are not yet broadly available for more reliable laboratory testing of antibodies, and it is too soon to know the real-world impacts on immunity. Nearly all the U.S. population has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from vaccination, previous infection, or both, and it is likely that these antibodies will continue to provide some protection against severe disease from this variant. This is an area of ongoing scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nGiven that the CDC had not stated that individuals who had received the COVID-19 vaccine were more susceptible to the new variant than those who had not been vaccinated, we have rated this claim as \"False.\"",
        "justification": "The evaluation of \"F\" (false) for this news item is justified because the claim that the CDC stated vaccinated people are at higher risk of Covid infection than the unvaccinated is a misrepresentation of CDC data and communications. The CDC\u2019s actual \u201cRisk Assessment Summary for SARS-CoV-2 Sublineage BA.2.86\u201d (August 2023) does not state that vaccinated individuals are at higher risk than unvaccinated. Instead, it says the variant \u201cmay be more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines\u201d due to the virus\u2019s ability to partially evade immunity, not because vaccination increases risk above that of never being vaccinated or infected.\n\nMultiple studies and CDC data have demonstrated that, while new variants can reduce the effectiveness of prior immunity (whether from vaccines or prior infections), vaccines remain effective at reducing severe outcomes, especially hospitalization and death (CDC, 2023; NEJM, 2023). There is no statement or data from the CDC supporting the idea that vaccination increases risk beyond that of no vaccination or infection. Claims suggesting otherwise are typically based on misunderstandings or distortions of immunological terms such as \u201cimmune escape.\u201d\n\nThus, the article\u2019s central assertion is not supported by the CDC or scientific consensus, justifying its assessment as false.",

        "justification": "The evaluation of \"partially false\" (PF) is appropriate for this news item. It is true that, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Minnesota (where Governor Tim Walz serves) included race and ethnicity as risk factors in frameworks for allocating scarce monoclonal antibody treatments. This was done because nonwhite populations were statistically shown to face higher risks of severe Covid outcomes.\n\nHowever, the claim is misleading in critical ways. First, race was only one of several factors used in clinical scoring systems; it did not automatically grant treatment or deny it to others. Secondly, being nonwhite was not \"more important\" than hypertension; whereas hypertension gave 1 point, nonwhite race or Hispanic ethnicity gave 2 points, similar to other comorbidities like diabetes. Importantly, this system aimed to address known health disparities, not to discriminate.\n\nThe claim that Walz \u201ckilled\u201d people based on these criteria is unfounded speculation without evidence. There is no data demonstrating that any patient died as a result of these triage guidelines.

However, multiple life-cycle analyses (such as those published by the International Council on Clean Transportation and the European Environment Agency) indicate that emissions from battery manufacturing are typically equivalent to driving a conventional petrol car for approximately 1.5 to 3.5 years, depending on factors like the battery size, energy mix in battery production, and vehicle efficiency. \n\nStudies do not support the \"eight years\" figure; that overstates the environmental cost of battery manufacture. Furthermore, although electric vehicles (EVs) have higher initial emissions due to battery production, their overall lifetime emissions are usually much lower than those of petrol vehicles, especially when charged with cleaner electricity.

Trophy hunting accounts for a much smaller fraction of total elephant mortalities.\n\n3. **Effectiveness of ESA Listing:** While listing African elephants as \"Endangered\" under the U.S. Endangered Species Act would strengthen protections and could restrict trophy imports into the U.S., it would not, \"once and for all,\" stop all ivory trade or worldwide trophy hunting, as these also involve international laws and enforcement beyond U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nThus, the news contains some accurate elements but also overstates and simplifies key facts, justifying the \"partially false\" rating.",

According to the Congressional Budget Office, USAID, the government\u2019s largest agency for non-military aid, spends about 4 percent of its funds on direct aid to foreign governments. A trade publication reported that 70 percent of the agency\u2019s money ran through U.S.-based organizations.\r\n\r\nThe use of contracts and grants has grown over the past three decades. An independent aid analyst said the general pattern at USAID applies across the other government offices that oversee foreign assistance.\r\n\r\nWe rate this claim True.",
        "justification": "The evaluation of \"True\" (T) for this news item is justified. First, it is accurate that a large portion of current U.S. foreign assistance is not directly provided to foreign governments. According to official data from USAID and the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the majority of U.S. foreign aid flows through contracts and grants awarded to U.S.-based implementing partners, such as private companies, nonprofit organizations, and NGOs, rather than being given as direct budget support to foreign governments.\n\nThese implementing organizations generally deliver aid projects in recipient countries, often working with local partners and hiring both American and local staff, as described. Moreover, aid and development practitioners routinely use project management best practices\u2014such as establishing measurable targets, monitoring progress, adapting approaches, and seeking cost-effectiveness\u2014to maximize taxpayer value. These practices are well-documented in reports from USAID, the World Bank, and other major donors. Thus, both the structure of U.S. foreign aid flows and the professional standards referenced in the statement are well-supported by authoritative sources, justifying the \"True\" assessment.",

        "original_reasoning_text": "In short, according to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data from fiscal years 2009 to 2016, more than 3 million individuals were formally removed during the Obama administration. Including returns, cases in which noncitizens left the U.S. voluntarily or after withdrawing their application for admission without undergoing formal removal proceedings, the total number of departures exceeded 5 million.\r\n\r\nClaims that 75% to 83% of those deported \"never saw a judge or had a chance to plead their case\" are based on statistics from individual years, particularly 2012 and 2013. These percentages refer to so-called \"summary removals\" carried out through legal procedures such as \"expedited removal\" and \"reinstatement of removal,\" which do not involve a hearing before an immigration judge. From 2009 to 2016, these two categories combined made up anywhere between 58% and 84% of all formal removals annually, averaging about 74% over the entire period. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we rate this claim as mostly true.",
        "justification": "The evaluation of this news item as \"True\" (T) is justified. Reliable sources, including data from the Department of Homeland Security and analyses by immigration watchdogs (e.g., Migration Policy Institute, Pew Research), confirm that during President Obama's tenure, over 3 million removals/deportations occurred. The majority\u201475\u201383%\u2014were categorized as \u201cremovals\u201d but were actually fast-track processes, such as \u201cexpedited removal\u201d and \u201cvoluntary return,\u201d predominantly at the border. These processes do not involve formal hearings before immigration judges.\n\nThis pattern predates Obama; under Presidents Clinton and Bush, similar expedited removal methods were used, and most deportees did not get judicial hearings. Immigration experts verify that U.S. law permits authorities to remove certain unauthorized entrants without a judge's review, especially if caught near the border or within days of entry.\n\nWhile the comment about \"outrage\" is opinion-based, the factual claims about historic practice and legal processes for deportation are well-supported. No president, including Trump, has been required to obtain court permission before most removals at the border, confirming this is long-standing policy rather than unique to any administration.",
