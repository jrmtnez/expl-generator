They found that blood type A patients showed a higher rate of infection and they tended to develop more severe symptoms.\r\n\r\nWhile the researchers said the study was preliminary and more work was needed, they did urge governments and medical facilities to consider blood type differences when planning mitigation measures or treating patients with the virus, known as Sars-CoV-2.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople of blood group A might need particularly strengthened personal protection to reduce the chance of infection,\u201d wrote the researchers led by Wang Xinghuan with the Centre for Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.\r\n\r\n\u201cSars-CoV-2-infected patients with blood group A might need to receive more vigilant surveillance and aggressive treatment,\u201d Wang wrote.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, \u201cblood group O had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease compared with non-O blood groups\u201d, according to a paper they published on Medrxiv.org on March 11.\r\n\r\nOf 206 patients who had died from Covid-19 in Wuhan, 85 had type A blood, which was 63 per cent more than the 52 with type O. The pattern existed across different age and gender groups.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might be helpful to introduce ABO blood typing in both patients and medical personnel as a routine part of the management of Sars-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections, to help define the management options and assess risk exposure levels of people,\u201d Wang wrote in the paper.\r\n\r\nThe study was conducted by scientists and doctors from cities across China including Beijing, Wuhan, Shanghai and Shenzhen. It has not been peer reviewed, and the authors cautioned that there could be risks involved in using the study to guide current clinical practice.\r\n\r\nGao Yingdai, a researcher with the State Key Laboratory of Experimental Haematology in Tianjin who was not involved in the study, said it could be improved with a larger sample size. Though 2,000 was not small, it is dwarfed by the total number of patients infected by the coronavirus, now exceeding 180,000 globally.\r\n\r\nAnother limitation of the study was that it did not provide a clear explanation about the phenomenon, such as the molecular interaction between the virus and different types of red blood cells, Gao said.\r\n\r\nBlood types are determined by a so-called antigen, a material on the surface of red blood cells that can trigger an immune response. Austrian biologist Karl Landsteiner discovered the main blood groups in 1901, naming them type A, B, AB and O. The discovery allowed for safe blood transfusions by matching blood types in patients.\r\n\r\nBlood types vary in a population. In the United States, about 44 per cent of the population is type O, while about 41 per cent is type A. In Wuhan, which has a population of about 11 million, type O is 32 per cent, while A is 34 per cent among healthy people. Among Covid-19 patients, it was about 38 and 25 per cent.\r\n\r\nScientists are still unsure how different blood groups evolved, though one theory is that they are a genetic memory of plagues. Others argue that environmental factors such as altitude, temperature or humidity might have played a role to favour the increase of certain blood type populations.\r\n\r\nBlood type difference has been observed in other infectious diseases including Norwalk virus, hepatitis B and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), according to previous studies.\r\n\r\nGao at the Tianjin lab said the new study \u201cmay be helpful to medical professionals, but ordinary citizens should not take the statistics too seriously\u201d. \u201cIf you are type A, there is no need to panic. It does not mean you will be infected 100 per cent,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you are type O, it does not mean you are absolutely safe, either. You still need to wash your hands and follow the guidelines issued by authorities.\u201d",

        "text": "New Study Claims Marijuana Leads to \u201cComplete Remission\u201d of Crohn\u2019s Disease with No Side Effects\r\nOne of the hottest\u2013 and most controversial!\u2014 political conversations that has arisen in the past several years has to do with one very potent plant: marijuana.\r\n\r\nHumans have been using it since 6000 B.C. for food, medicinal purposes, and, sometimes, a good time, but it wasn\u2019t until recently that certain local governments in the U.S. have started easing up on the strict laws that prohibit its use.\r\n\r\nAs of May 2018, an impressive 26 states have passed laws to legalize the sale of either recreational or medicinal marijuana. Although it\u2019s not legal federally in any state, it\u2019s safe to assume that it very well could be in the near future.\r\n\r\nNow, whatever your own personal beliefs may be on the topic of marijuana, recreational or otherwise, it\u2019s important to consider what the plant can do for those suffering from chronic illnesses, like Crohn\u2019s Disease.\r\n\r\nIn a 2013 study published in the medical journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, researchers found that, in a test group of 21 severely-affected individuals, consistent use of medical marijuana quieted symptoms in most and even contributed to complete remission in about half of the participants.\r\nSo, why did the medical marijuana have such a positive effect on these Crohn\u2019s patients? Researchers point to the plant\u2019s natural anti-inflammatory properties for easing the often painful symptoms. The plant\u2019s high THC account relaxes inflamed parts of the body, allowing patients relief from pain without any negative side effects to speak of.\r\n\r\nThough this particular study only included a small pool of subjects, it has continued to get attention over the years as the prescribing of medical marijuana has become more and more prevalent. Simply put, it serves as a ray of hope for those who rely on side-effect-ridden steroids to keep their symptoms under control.\r\n\r\nNow, it\u2019s important to note that even the researchers who took part in the groundbreaking study urge that more thorough trials will need to be conducted, but these results sure do sound like promising ones!\r\nWhat is Crohn\u2019s Disease?\r\nCrohn\u2019s Disease is an immune deficiency state that can be caused by a plethora of environmental, immunological, and genetic factors. Typically, Crohn\u2019s Disease patients suffer from constant inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, an issue that can cause abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and fevers.\r\n\r\nSadly, there is no cure for Crohn\u2019s Disease, though there are a host of plans available to patients, from the aforementioned medical marijuana treatments to dietary changes to medications to, in some cases, surgeries.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are an estimated 400,000-600,000 patients who have been diagnosed with the disease in North America alone. Although medical marijuana for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s Disease is still not widely-prescribed, with more thorough trials, one day it may just become powerful enough to replace the current, more invasive treatments.\r\n\r\nImpressive stuff! We sure do hope that Crohn\u2019s patients get the relief that they deserve!\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this study. Do you suffer from Crohn\u2019s Disease? If so, have you been prescribed medical marijuana? Do you have any advice for those beginning treatment for the disease?",

Furthermore, the article's claim that the plant's high THC relaxes inflamed parts of the body, allowing patients relief from pain without any negative side effects, is also not supported by evidence.

The same and later research, including reviews and meta-analyses published in reputable journals (e.g., JAMA in 2021), indicate that although some patients experienced symptom relief, there is no definitive evidence that cannabis induces remission.

        "text": "Drinking One Diet Drink A Day Can Triple Risk Of Dementia And Strokes\r\nIt\u2019s true. According to a new study, drinking just one diet soda per day can triple your risk of dementia and stroke. \r\n\r\nThe study, published in the science journal Stroke, looked at the consumption of beverages sweetened with sugar and artificial sweeteners. The interesting thing is that the increased risk was not seen with just sugary drinks.  In fact, according to researchers there wasn\u2019t even a hint of evidence that sugary drinks caused strokes or dementia. \r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, Boston University researchers found aspartame, a low-calorie sweetener, severely damages the arteries \u2013 as opposed to sugar-sweetened drinks. What this means is that drinking diet soda is far worse for your health than drinking regular soda sweetened with sugar.\r\n\r\nThe results of the study showed that adults who had one or more diet drinks a day were 2.9 times more likely to develop dementia and increased their risk by 3 times of having a stroke, when compared to those who didn\u2019t drink any.  \r\n\r\nThe research team from Boston University believes that the artificial sweeteners including aspartame and saccharine may have a negative effect on blood vessels, which can eventually trigger strokes and dementia.\r\n\r\nData was collected on 2,888 adults older than 45 and 1,484 adults older than 60 from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. This data came from the Framingham Heart Study, a project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Boston University.\r\n\r\nOver seven years, the research team used food frequency questionnaires up to three different points in time. They then followed up for the next 10 years to determine who developed stroke and dementia.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the follow-up period, researchers counted 97 strokes, or 3 percent of the participants in the stroke analysis arm of the study. Of those, 82 were ischemic. The study also found 81 cases of dementia, or 5 percent of the participants in the dementia arm of the study. Of those, 63 had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\r\n\r\nA senior research fellow in the department of neurology at Boston University Mathew Pase and the author of the new study said, \u201cOur study shows a need to put more research into this area given how often people drink artificially sweetened beverages.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough we did not find an association between stroke or dementia and the consumption of sugary drinks, this certainly does not mean they are a healthy option. We recommend that people drink water on a regular basis instead of sugary or artificially sweetened beverages.\u201d\r\nJust One A Day\r\n\r\nThere you have it, drinking one diet drink per day can triple your risk of stroke or dementia. Just one a day! But don\u2019t think that means you can still reach for the sugary sodas. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that drinking sugary drinks is bad too. They\u2019re believed to contribute not just to rising levels of obesity, but also other health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, dental cavities and cancer. Instead, just drink more water.

        "text": "Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug. Many individuals are incidentally exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke, but little is known about the effects of this exposure. This report examines the physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive effects of secondhand cannabis exposure, and the influence of room ventilation on these effects. Non-cannabis-using individuals were exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke from six individuals smoking cannabis (11.3% THC) ad libitum in a specially constructed chamber for one hour. Chamber ventilation was experimentally manipulated so that participants were exposed under unventilated conditions or with ventilation at a rate of 11 air exchanges/hour. Physiological, subjective and behavioral/cognitive measures of cannabis exposure assessed after exposure sessions were compared to baseline measures. Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke under unventilated conditions produced detectable cannabinoid levels in blood and urine, minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate self-reported sedative drug effects, and impaired performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST). One urine specimen tested positive at using a 50 ng/mL cut-off and several specimens were positive at 20 ng/mL. Exposure under ventilated conditions resulted in much lower blood cannabinoid levels, and did not produce sedative drug effects, impairments in performance, or positive urine screen results. Room ventilation has a pronounced effect on exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke. Under extreme, unventilated conditions, secondhand cannabis smoke exposure can produce detectable levels of THC in blood and urine, minor physiological and subjective drug effects, and minor impairment on a task requiring psychomotor ability and working memory. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug globally (World Health Organization, 2014). The most popular route of administration is smoking, which often occurs indoors, in automobiles, or in other areas where ventilation is limited or variable. \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of cannabis, is present in both mainstream smoke (inhaled by the user) and sidestream smoke (dispersed into environment; Cone et al., 1987; Fehr and Kalant, 1972; Matthais et al., 1997). Metabolism of THC yields the psychoactive metabolite, 11-hydroxy-\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC), which is present in blood after active or passive exposure to cannabis smoke (Huestis et al., 1992; Moore et al., 2011). THC and 11-OH-THC have similar behavioral effects, but 11-OH-THC levels peak later than THC levels after cannabis exposure (Hollister and Gillespie, 1975; Huestis et al., 1992; J\u00e4rbe et al., 1994; Kosersky et al., 1974; Lemberger et al., 1973). Metabolism of 11-OH-THC yields 11-nor-9-carboxy- \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH). THC-COOH is non-psychoactive, but its long half-life (~140 hours) makes it a common biomarker in urine testing for cannabis use. Many individuals are passively exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke given the current prevalence and patterns of cannabis use, however, there has been little controlled research examining the consequences of secondhand exposure. Most research on secondhand cannabis smoke exposure has focused on detection of cannabinoids (e.g., THC, 11-OH-THC, THC-COOH) in various biological matrices. Cone and Johnson (1986) exposed five healthy men to passive smoke from either 4 or 16 cannabis cigarettes (2.8% THC) in a small, enclosed room for one hour each day on six consecutive days. This secondhand smoke exposure reliably produced detectable levels of cannabinoids in urine and plasma, which varied in an orderly relation to dose (i.e., cannabinoid levels were higher after exposure to smoke from 16 cannabis cigarettes vs. 4 cigarettes). Similar results were obtained from studies using comparable designs (i.e., secondhand cannabis smoke exposure in small closed rooms or motor vehicles; Law et al., 1984; Mason et al., 1983; M\u00f8rland et al., 1985; Perez-Reyes et al., 1983). At least four limitations impede interpretation of these studies with regard to current real-world secondhand cannabis smoke exposure scenarios. First, exposure in these studies always occurred under the \u201cextreme\u201d conditions (i.e., in small spaces without ventilation). Because secondhand cannabis exposure in the real world occurs under conditions with different degrees of air ventilation (e.g., in rooms with air conditioning or open windows, or outdoors), research examining the effects of ventilation on exposure levels is needed. Second, the average potency of \u201cstreet\u201d cannabis has increased more than 3-fold in the time since these studies were conducted (sinsemilla cannabis seized from 2002\u20132008 by federal and state law enforcement agencies in the U.S. averaged 11.1% to 11.9% THC; Mehmedic et al., 2010). To our knowledge, only one controlled study has examined passive exposure to higher potency cannabis (10.4% THC) that more closely resembles street cannabis available today (Niedbala et al., 2005). A more thorough examination of secondhand exposure using higher potency cannabis is needed to better model passive exposure to today\u2019s cannabis and its potential effects on drug test results. Third, only one study has reported both physiological and subjective effects of secondhand cannabis exposure (Cone and Johnson, 1986). Cone and Johnson (1986) reported that secondhand cannabis exposure had no systematic effects on heart rate or blood pressure, and that participant\u2019s ratings of subjective drug effects increased significantly after exposure to smoke from 16 cannabis cigarettes relative to placebo ratings. These effects were most pronounced during the first hour after exposure, and resolved within three hours. Fourth, no prior studies have evaluated the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure on behavioral/cognitive performance. Expanded research on the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure in the areas outlined above is timely and warranted. The present study was conducted to examine the influence of variations in cannabis potency (5.3% THC vs. 11.3% THC) and in room ventilation (unventilated vs. standard residential ventilation) on the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure. The primary objective of the study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of cannabinoids in various biological matrices following secondhand smoke exposure in order to inform federal workplace drug testing standards. A detailed report of the urine cannabinoid concentrations has been previously published (Cone et al., 2015). Here, we report the outcomes of pharmacodynamic assessments, cannabinoid concentrations in whole blood, and provide a brief summary of the urine results. Data analysis was restricted to comparisons of the ventilated vs. unventilated sessions with the same potency of cannabis (11.3% THC) because over 40% more 11.3% THC cannabis was consumed than 5.3% THC cannabis (14.4 grams total vs. 10.2 grams total) in comparable (unventilated) study sessions. The different levels of cannabis consumption between these 2 conditions preclude our ability to validly compare the effects of cannabis potency on study outcomes, particularly pharmacodynamic measures. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the effect of room ventilation on secondhand cannabis smoke exposure and is among the few secondhand cannabis smoke studies to examine pharmacodynamic outcomes or utilize cannabis with a potency that is representative of current \u201cstreet\u201d cannabis.  Frequent cannabis users and cannabis nonusers were recruited from the greater Baltimore, MD area via media advertising and word-of-mouth communication. Interested participants completed a screening session to determine eligibility. Participants provided written informed consent during the screening session. The Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine approved this study.  Cannabis users were eligible to participate as smokers if they: (1) were 18\u201345 years old, (2) reported using cannabis at least two times per week throughout the past 90 days, (3) provided a urine specimen that was positive for THC-COOH and negative for other drugs of abuse at screening and on the day of each study session, (4) had a negative breath alcohol reading at screening and on the day of each study session, (5) had a body mass index of 19\u201334 kg/m2, (6) were judged to be in good general heath based on physical examination, and (7) were not pregnant or nursing. Cannabis users were encouraged to participate in all three of the exposure sessions as a means of reducing between-session variability in smoke exposure among nonsmokers. Smokers were instructed to remain abstinent from cannabis overnight prior to exposure sessions.  Individuals who were not current cannabis users were eligible to participate in the study if they: (1) were 18\u201345 years old, (2) reported cannabis use at least once in their lifetime, but not within the prior 6 months, (3) provided a urine specimen that was negative for drugs of abuse at screening and on the day of study admission, (4) had a negative breath alcohol reading at screening and on the day of participation, (5) had a BMI ranging from 19\u201334 kg/m2, (6) were judged to be in good general heath based on a full physical examination, and (7) were not pregnant or nursing. Each nonsmoker participated in only one exposure session due to concern that residual effects of cannabis exposure in one session might influence results of subsequent sessions. Because the primary aim of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetic profile of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure, we restricted the nonsmoker group to individuals who were not current cannabis users so that they would not have residual cannabinoids in biological matrices (e.g., urine, saliva) at baseline. Three secondhand cannabis exposure sessions were conducted at the Johns Hopkins University Bayview campus. The first session involved exposure to cannabis containing 5.3% THC in an unventilated environment, the second session involved exposure to cannabis containing 11.3% THC in an unventilated environment, and the third session involved exposure to cannabis containing 11.3% THC in a ventilated environment. We only describe results from the second and third sessions here. Smokers and non-smokers arrived at approximately 0700 hours on session days. Drug and alcohol testing was conducted upon arrival to confirm that participants still met study eligibility requirements regarding substance use. Smokers were reminded of abstinence requirements the day before each session took place, and study staff met with active smokers when they arrived on session days to check for signs of recent cannabis use (e.g., bloodshot eyes, odor of cannabis smoke) to verify reported abstinence. Nonsmokers were required to urine test negative for cannabis. Nursing staff placed an intravenous catheter in the non-dominant arm of each participant for repeated blood sampling. Tobacco and caffeine use was not permitted during study sessions. One nonsmoker was a daily tobacco user, and was provided with nicotine patches in order to reduce the potential effect of nicotine withdrawal on study outcomes. After completing baseline assessments, 6 cannabis smokers and 6 nonsmokers entered a specially constructed smoke exposure chamber (approximately 0900 hours). The chamber measured 10 ft. \u00d7 13 ft. (3.05 m \u00d7 3.96 m) with a 7 ft. (2.13 m) ceiling, was constructed using a combination of Plexiglas and aluminum support beams, and incorporated an adjustable ventilation/exhaust system. Smokers and nonsmokers sat around a table in alternating seats. All participants wore protective clothing over their normal clothes (disposable booties, jumpsuits) during the exposure session, and were provided with swimming goggles to prevent eye irritation from accumulated smoke. During the unventilated exposure session, ducts at both the intake and exhaust manifolds of the chamber were capped, eliminating the inflow/outflow of air. During the ventilated session a central air conditioning unit fed cool air through a 9.5 in2 (24 cm2) intake register at one end of the chamber. On the opposite end, air was exhausted through a 9.5 in2 (24 cm2) register into a ventilation shaft that contained a motorized fan. The ventilation system was calibrated to achieve an airflow rate of 11 air-exchanges/hour, which is consistent with residential ventilation standards based on the size of the chamber. Other than the differences in ventilation and select study participants, both session protocols were identical. Each smoker was provided with 10 cannabis cigarettes obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Drug Supply Program and a CReSS Pocket smoking topography device (Borgwaldt KC, Richmond, VA, USA). Each cannabis cigarette contained approximately 1 gram of high potency (11.3% THC) cannabis. The door to the chamber was sealed using magnetic strips around the frame of the door at the start of each 60-minute exposure session. Active smokers were instructed to smoke the provided cannabis cigarettes ad libitum through the CReSS device, which measured the number of puffs taken, puff volume, and other parameters of smoking behavior. Participants were instructed to remain seated for the entirety of the session, but were allowed to engage in leisure activities (e.g., talking, reading, using personal electronic devices, etc.). Research staff monitored the exposure session from outside the chamber to ensure nonsmokers did not actively inhale from the cannabis cigarettes and that smokers only consumed cigarettes from their own supply. Pulse oximeters were used to monitor blood oxygen concentration of study participants every 15 minutes to ensure an adequate oxygen supply was maintained in the chamber. After 60 minutes the door to the exposure chamber was opened; participants then exited the chamber, immediately discarded protective clothing, and washed their hands and face to minimize contamination of biological samples collected after exposure. Participants then proceeded to a large room where they completed study assessments at regular intervals for 8 hours post-exposure among smokers and 34 hours post-exposure among non-smokers.  The total weight of cannabis cigarettes, including butts and loose plant material, was obtained for each participant prior to and immediately after each session to determine the amount of cannabis combusted. We examined CReSS data on total puff volume to assess temporal characteristics of cannabis consumption. Biological samples (blood, urine, saliva, hair) were obtained for 8-hours post exposure among smokers and for up to 34 hours among nonsmokers. Whole blood specimens (10 mL) were obtained from indwelling venous catheters using grey-top vacutainer blood collection tubes at baseline, immediately after exiting the smoke chamber (Time \u201c0\u201d) and 0.5 (30 minutes), 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 22, 26, 30, and 34 hours after exposure. Spot urine specimens were collected hourly for the first 4 hours and then pooled specimens were obtained for hours 6\u20138, 8\u201310, 10\u201312, 12\u201322, 22\u201326, 26\u201330, and 30\u201334. Quantitative testing for cannabinoids (THC, 11-OH-THC, THC-COOH) in whole blood was conducted by Immunalysis Corp (Pomona, CA) using LC/MS/MS, with a 0.5 ng/mL limit of quantitation. Urinalysis testing for THC-COOH was performed by Clinical Reference Laboratory (Lenexa, KS) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with cut-offs of both 20 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL and confirmatory GS/MS with a 0.75 ng/mL limit of quantitation (see Cone et al., 2015).  Heart rate (BPM) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm/hg) were measured using automated monitors while participants were in the seated position at baseline, immediately after exiting the smoke exposure chamber (Time \u201c0\u201d), and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 22, 26, 30, and 34 hours post-exposure.  Participants completed a 15-item Drug Effect Questionnaire (DEQ) to assess subjective ratings of drug effects. Individual items on the DEQ included three ratings of drug effects (\u201cdo you feel a drug effect?,\u201d \u201cdo you feel a pleasant drug effect?,\u201d \u201cdo you feel an unpleasant drug effect?\u201d) and twelve ratings of behavioral/mood states often associated with cannabis intoxication (\u201csick\u201d, \u201cheart racing\u201d, \u201canxious\u201d, \u201crelaxed\u201d, \u201cparanoid\u201d, \u201ctired\u201d, \u201calert\u201d, \u201cirritable\u201d, \u201cvigorous\u201d, \u201crestless\u201d, \u201chungry/have munchies\u201d, \u201ccraving cannabis\u201d). Participants rated each item using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) anchored with \u201cnot at all\u201d on one end and \u201cextremely\u201d on the other. The DEQ was administered at baseline and at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 22, 26, 30, and 34 hours post-exposure.  Participants completed three different computerized behavioral tasks to assess aspects of psychomotor/cognitive performance known to be sensitive to the acute effects of smoked cannabis and relevant to functioning in the workplace and/or operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery (Hooker and Jones, 1987; Wilson et al., 1994). Study participants completed each task three times during the screening visit while under the supervision of study staff in order to ensure proper understanding and minimize the influence of practice effects on task performance during the study, and were administered at baseline and at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 hours post-exposure.  On this task, participants simultaneously tracked a central stimulus and monitored peripheral stimuli. The central stimulus was a diamond that moved back and forth horizontally across the computer screen. Participants were instructed to track this stimulus using the computer mouse while monitoring a target digit at the lower center of the computer screen. Peripheral stimuli were digits (1\u20139) that appeared in each of the four corners of the screen. Participants were instructed to click the computer mouse once each time one of the digits in the corners of the screen matched the target digit. Task duration was 6 minutes. Primary outcomes on the DAT are the number of correct peripheral targets identified, reaction time (milliseconds) on correct responses, and mean distance (number of pixels) of cursor from the central stimulus.  On this task, participants viewed a series of nine geometric patterns. Each pattern was numbered (1\u20139) and consisted of three highlighted squares on a 3\u00d73 grid. When the number associated with a particular pattern appeared on the center of the screen, participants were instructed to replicate the shape of that pattern using the an assigned 3\u00d73 section of the computer keyboard. Task duration was 90 seconds. Primary outcomes of the DSST were total number of trials attempted, total number correct, and percentage of attempted trials completed correctly.  On this task, participants were presented with a string of single digit integers on the computer screen. Participants were instructed to calculate the sum of each successive pair of integers presented and select the correct answer from a list of choices displayed on the screen using the computer mouse. These integers appeared on the screen every 2.8 seconds during the initial battery of 30 trials. Following a 30 second break, integers appeared every 2.4 seconds during the second battery of 60 additional trials. Task duration was 5 minutes. Primary outcomes on the PASAT were total number of trials correct, and reaction time (milliseconds) on correct items. Demographic variables were compared between smokers and nonsmokers, and between nonsmokers in unventilated and ventilated sessions using independent-samples t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. We limited analyses to the time window when subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects were likely to be observed because of the abundance of zero or near-zero blood cannabinoids levels and subjective drug effect ratings at later post-exposure time points. To select this window, we plotted levels of THC and of 11-OH-THC in whole blood at baseline and during the first four hours post-exposure to examine total intoxicant exposure during the post-exposure timeframe when effects are typically present. Blood cannabinoid levels peaked immediately after exposure and declined to below the level of quantitation by 90 minutes post-exposure among nonsmokers. DEQ ratings of \u201cfeel drug effect\u201d appeared to parallel changes in blood cannabinoid levels among both smokers and nonsmokers (see Figure 1). Consequently, we limited outcome analyses of physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive effects to the first hour after cannabis exposure. Whole blood THC levels, whole blood 11-OH-THC levels, heart rate (BPM) and DEQ visual analog scale ratings (VAS, 0\u2013100) of \u201cfeel drug effect\u201d among smokers and nonsmokers in unventilated and ventilated study conditions. Error bars are standard error of the mean. We fit mixed effects regression models (Gueorguieva and Krystal, 2004) to assess differences between baseline and the first hour post-exposure for each measure. This model allowed us to compare the mean difference between baseline values and post-exposure values while accounting for (1) within-subject variability among post-exposure time points collected during the first hour after exposure within each session, and (2) between-session variability among baseline measures and post-exposure measures for the five active smokers who completed both exposure sessions. Data from active smokers who participated in multiple sessions were analyzed together and are presented together because their levels of cannabinoid exposure did not significantly differ as a function of room ventilation (see Figure 1). The absence of significant effects of cannabis exposure on heart rate among active smokers using mixed effects regression models that included data from the first hour post exposure prompted follow up comparisons between heart rate at baseline and heart rate at Time 0 using a second set of mixed effects regression models in order to examine if any transient effects on heart rate were present in smokers and in nonsmokers. Smokers and nonsmokers were not compared. Data on smokers are presented to serve as a reference for evaluating the levels of biological exposure and corresponding drug effects among nonsmokers. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and significance was determined at p < 0.05. Table 1 shows demographics of the nineteen participants (7 smokers and 12 nonsmokers) who completed the high potency (11.3% THC) unventilated and ventilated sessions of the study. Seven smokers were included in analyses because one of the original six participants who completed the unventilated session withdrew from the study and was replaced. There were no significant differences between these groups on any of the variables examined. Demographic characteristics among smokers, nonsmokers in the unventilated session, nonsmokers in the ventilated session. Average grams of cannabis consumed per study session among smokers. Note. SD = standard deviation, kg/M2 = weight in kilograms/height in meters squared, Smokers consumed a considerable amount of cannabis in both the unventilated (14.4 grams total) and ventilated (16.5 grams total) exposure sessions. The chamber was visibly very smoky during the unventilated session (became difficult to see through to the opposing wall clearly; see Figure 2 in Cone et al., 2015). Cannabis smoke was visible during the ventilated session, but it did not obstruct chamber transparency. CReSS data were available for 10/12 smoking bouts (one CReSS device malfunctioned in the unventilated session and the battery died for one unit during the ventilated session). Data on puff volume indicated that smokers consumed 34% less cannabis during the second 30 minutes of the exposure period than during the first 30 minutes. Participants tolerated both study sessions well, with some complaints of mild eye irritation during the unventilated session, mainly among participants who did not wear or removed their protective eye goggles.  Figure 1 shows mean blood THC levels, blood 11-OH-THC levels, heart rate, and ratings of \u201cfeel drug effect\u201d among smokers and nonsmokers at baseline and during the first four hours after exposure. All smokers had detectible levels of THC (mean 4.5 ng/ml) and 11-OH-THC (mean 2.4 ng/ml) at baseline, though all reported overnight abstinence and did not show any evidence of recent cannabis use (e.g., cannabis odor, bloodshot eyes). Blood levels of THC and 11-OH-THC peaked immediately following exposure in both sessions (means of 20.7 ng/ml and 5.6 ng/ml, respectively), and returned to baseline within 4 hours.   None of the nonsmokers in the unventilated session had detectable blood cannabinoids at baseline, but all six had detectible levels of THC following secondhand smoke exposure. Levels peaked immediately following exposure (Time 0 mean = 3.2 ng/ml), and remained detectible (>0.5 ng/mL) for 1\u20133 hours post-exposure. Only one participant had detectible levels of 11-OH-THC following exposure. One urine specimen tested positive in accordance with federal drug testing guidelines (screen with ELISA >50 ng/ml THC-COOH and confirmed with GC/MS >15 ng/ml THC-COOH) 4 hours post-exposure. Using a lower cut-off that is common in some commercial drug testing programs (ELISA >20 ng/ml THC-COOH; GC/MS > 15 ng/mL), 4 of 6 nonsmokers produced urine samples that screened and confirmed positive with a window of detection that ranged from 2 to 22 hours post-exposure.  None of the nonsmokers in the ventilated session had detectable blood cannabinoids at baseline. Four of the six nonsmokers had detectible levels of blood cannabinoids immediately following exposure. These levels were lower than those observed in the unventilated session (Time 0 mean = 0.7 ng/ml), and were not detectable after Time 0. None of these participants had detectible levels of 11-OH-THC following exposure. No urine samples collected from nonsmokers in the ventilated session screened positive, even using the lower (ELISA >20 ng/ml) cut-off level.  Table 2 shows detailed outcomes and results from analyses comparing baseline values to values from the first hour post-exposure for physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive study measures. No significant effects on heart rate were observed using the mixed effects regression model that compared baseline to the first hour post exposure (see Table 2). Follow-up analyses that compared baseline heart rate to heart rate at Time 0 indicated no main effect of ventilation condition [beta = 1.21 (SEM = 3.33), p = 0.72], a significant main effect of time, [beta = 10.00 (SEM = 3.20) p = .002), and no ventilation condition by time interaction [beta = \u22124.83 (SEM = 4.53), p = 0 .29]. These results indicate that heart rate was significantly higher at Time 0 compared with baseline (heart rate increased from 66.8 BPM vs. 76.8 BPM in the unventilated session, and 70.0 BPM vs. 75.2 BPM in the ventilated session following cannabis exposure) and that there was no statistically significantly difference in the effect of time on heart rate between the unventilated and ventilated conditions. A modest but statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed after cannabis use among smokers (see Table 2). No effect on diastolic blood pressure was observed. Physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive measures among smokers in both sessions, nonsmokers in the unventilated session, and nonsmokers in the ventilated session at the baseline assessment (pre) and the average of assessments during the first hour post-exposure (post). Significance levels were obtained using ANOVA, with significant differences (p < .05) between pre vs. post-exposure assessments are shown in bold. Note. BPM = beats per minute, mm Hg = millimeters of mercury, DEQ = drug effect questionnaire, VAS = visual analog scale   No significant effect on heart rate was observed with the initial fixed effect regression model comparing baseline heart rate to heart rate during the first hour post exposure (see Table 2). Follow up analyses comparing baseline heart rate to heart rate at Time 0 indicated a small, but statistically significant increase in heart rate [65.7 BPM vs. 71.7 BPM, beta = 6.00 (SEM = 2.78) p = 0.03]. There was a non-significant trend toward increased systolic blood pressure following exposure and no effect on diastolic blood pressure (see Table 2).  No significant effects on heart rate or blood pressure were observed (see Table 2).  Ratings of \u201cdrug effect,\u201d \u201cpleasant drug effect,\u201d \u201crelaxed,\u201d \u201cvigorous,\u201d and \u201chungry/have munchies\u201d were significantly higher than baseline during the hour following cannabis exposure. Craving for cannabis was significantly lower than baseline during this period. All of these effects resolved (i.e., returned to baseline) within 4 hours.   Ratings of \u201cdrug effect,\u201d \u201cpleasant drug effect,\u201d \u201ctired,\u201d and \u201chungry/have munchies\u201d were significantly higher than baseline during the hour post exposure. Ratings of \u201calert\u201d and \u201cvigorous\u201d were significantly lower. These effects resolved within 1.5 hours post exposure.  Ratings of \u201chungry/have munchies\u201d increased significantly from baseline during the first hour post exposure. No other subjective ratings showed significant changes.  Average cursor distance from target increased significantly from baseline during the first hour post exposure on the DAT, indicating decreased tracking accuracy. Performance did not differ from baseline on any other measures examined.   The number of DSST patterns attempted increased significantly from baseline during the hour post-exposure, but the percentage of attempted patterns that were completed correctly decreased significantly. There were no significant changes in total number correct on the DSST or performance on the DAT or PASAT.  The number of DSST patterns attempted and the number completed correctly increased significantly from baseline during the hour post exposure without a change in percent correct. Total number correct on the PASAT also increased significantly from baseline. Reaction time on the PASAT did not change, nor did performance on the DAT. This report describes the first study of which we are aware to examine the influence of room ventilation on secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke, and the first study to examine the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure on behavioral/cognitive performance. Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke in an unventilated chamber the size of a small room produced minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate subjective drug effects, and minor, but detectible, levels of performance impairment on some behavioral/cognitive assessments. The time course of these effects paralleled the levels of psychoactive cannabinoids in blood and was followed by detectable levels of THC-COOH in urine. The THC-COOH concentration in one specimen was sufficient to trigger a positive urine drug screen at a cut-off of >50 ng/ml (i.e., the cut-off recommended for use by the SAMHSA mandatory guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs), and multiple positive urine results were observed for four participants using a more stringent cut-off of >20 ng/ml, which is used by some commercial/private workplace drug testing programs, within a day of exposure. Ventilating the exposure chamber in a manner that approximated standard residential heating or air conditioning units dramatically reduced levels of exposure among nonsmokers, evidenced by much lower (in some cases undetectable) levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine and the absence of subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects. We observed some notable patterns in subjective drug effects. First, the effects reported by nonsmokers in the unventilated condition were small in magnitude and predominantly sedative in nature (increased ratings of \u201ctired\u201d decreased ratings of \u201calert\u201d and \u201cvigorous\u201d). In contrast, the subjective effects reported by active smokers were larger in magnitude and not exclusively sedative (increases in both \u201crelaxed\u201d and \u201cvigorous\u201d). Differential effects after smoking high-potency cannabis (9.75% and 23.12% THC) have been reported elsewhere in the literature (e.g., decreases in both \u201calertness\u201d and in \u201ccalmness\u201d; Hunault et al., 2014). Second, although absolute levels were low, the rise and fall of blood cannabinoid levels observed in nonsmokers following exposure in the unventilated condition paralleled the time course of subjective effects. Because nonsmokers in the ventilated condition did not report subjective drug effects, it is unlikely that the subjective intoxication reported by nonsmokers after the unventilated session was the result of social contagion, since nonsmoking participants were around equivalently-intoxicated active smokers during both study sessions while assessments were being completed. Furthermore, in a prior study of controlled smoked cannabis in our laboratory, subjective drug effects remained elevated from baseline an hour after exposure, while mean plasma THC levels had returned to baseline (about 7 ng/mL) (Milman et al., 2014; Vandrey et al., 2013). Indeed, blood cannabinoid concentrations typically peak immediately after inhalation and degrade rapidly, and do not necessarily reflect levels of intoxication (see Hollister et al., 1981). However, the influence of expectancy effects resulting from the smokiness of the chamber in the unventilated session was not controlled for, may have affected results, and should be considered when interpreting these outcomes. Nonsmokers in the ventilated session did not have detectable levels of cannabinoids in blood beyond the initial 30 minutes following the exposure period, did not screen positive on urine tests, and did not report significant increases in subjective drug effects except for \u201chungry/have munchies.\u201d Because this increase did not correspond with any other ratings of drug effect, we interpret the increase in hunger as unrelated to cannabis exposure (lunch hour was approaching). These findings suggest that ventilation dramatically reduces secondhand smoke exposure, even when large quantities of cannabis (~16.5 grams) are smoked in relatively small spaces in a short amount of time. Although room ventilation reduced levels of exposure among nonsmokers, ventilation appeared to have very little effect on levels of cannabinoids in blood or subjective effects among smokers. Smokers consumed an average of 2.6 grams of cannabis each through active smoking, thus, the comparatively small amounts of THC absorbed passively by smokers in the unventilated condition were likely not sufficient to produce additional effects. The finding that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke under extreme unventilated conditions can produce minor, but detectible impairments in performance on a task that measures psychomotor ability and working memory is novel. Passive exposure increased speed of responding but decreased accuracy, reflecting speed-accuracy trade-offs that are consistent with the effects of THC on behavioral/cognitive performance observed among infrequent cannabis users (e.g., Curran et al., 2002). In addition, individuals in the ventilated session showed post-exposure increases in both speed and accuracy on the DSST, and increases in accuracy on the PASAT. The lack of such practice effects among individuals in the unventilated condition may be further evidence of impaired performance, but that cannot be determined with confidence based on the design and small sample size of the present study. Interestingly, although smokers consumed large quantities of cannabis, had increased blood cannabinoid levels, and reported moderate to high levels of subjective effects, the expected increase in heart rate commonly associated with cannabis use was relatively small and only very minor signs of decreased performance on one measure of behavioral/cognitive performance (i.e., the DAT) were observed. This may reflect pharmacodynamic tolerance, as all of the active smokers were chronic heavy cannabis users. It is also possible that larger effects on heart rate and performance were missed. Smokers consumed cannabis over a 60-minute time period, and consumed 34% less cannabis during the second 30 minutes of the exposure period than during the first 30 minutes. Thus, it is possible that more robust physiological changes occurred and smokers were impaired during the exposure period, but this impairment resolved prior to post-exposure testing. The effects of cannabis smoking on heart rate may resolve within 45 minutes of smoking (Vandrey et al., 2013; Cooper and Haney, 2014), and heart rate was assessed 30, 60, and 90 minutes after many of the active smokers had ceased intensive smoking. The fact that significant differences in heart rate were observed among smokers when comparing baseline to Time 0, but not when comparing baseline to the first hour post exposure suggests that any effects on heart rate were transient. Although acute THC has been shown to reliably produce cognitive/working memory impairment (see Ranganathan and D\u2019Souza, 2006 for review), many of these studies recruited infrequent or moderate cannabis users. Heavier users may show little if any impairment (Ramaekers et al., 2009). Alternatively, the absence of observed cognitive effects may be the result of acute tolerance within study sessions. Additional research evaluating the effects of cannabis on working memory with infrequent users as smokers utilizing the current study procedure would help with interpretation of these results. The results of this study must be considered in light of its limitations. First, we did not conduct a placebo exposure session (i.e., session where cannabis devoid of THC was smoked), making it impossible to determine whether the subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects observed among active smokers and among nonsmokers in the unventilated session were the result of THC exposure or of expectancy. The design of this study would make a placebo session difficult, as active smokers would likely recognize 0% THC cannabis as placebo during the study session. Thus, it would be unlikely they would smoke sufficient quantities, and likely that they would be vocal about the absence of drug effects during the study session, thereby unblinding nonsmokers. There were a relatively small number of participants in each study session, and all participants were exposed to cannabis smoke and completed assessments simultaneously in the same laboratory room. As a result, it is possible that subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects reported by non-smokers may have been influenced by suggestibility or study demand characteristics. However, the finding that nonsmokers in the ventilated session did not show any drug effects, and that the effects observed among nonsmokers in the unventilated session closely paralleled levels of cannabinoids in blood indicate these effects may be the result of passively-absorbed THC. In addition, the experimental conditions created here do not reflect the full spectrum of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure scenarios that occur outside of the laboratory, and should not be interpreted to reflect normative conditions. This study models two scenarios of acute exposure in an enclosed room. The size of room, amount of cannabis consumed, duration of exposure, and frequency of such exposure are all variables that likely would influence outcomes in the real world. That said, several study participants reported previous secondhand exposure experiences that resembled the unventilated study condition, which indicates our exposure model has some degree of ecological validity. Furthermore, testing the effects of passive exposure among a balanced sample of women and men should be regarded as a strength because it speaks to the generality of our results. In conclusion, this study indicates that absorption of cannabinoids can result from secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke. Room ventilation had a significant impact on the degree of cannabinoid absorption and on resultant pharmacodynamic effects. Nonsmokers exposed under unventilated conditions reported low to moderate levels of sedative drug effects that corresponded with minor impairment in cognitive performance, while nonsmokers exposed under ventilated conditions reported no significant subjective effects and did not have impairment in cognitive performance. These results suggest that extreme conditions like those examined in this study may result in biological exposure sufficient to produce measureable subjective effects, decreases in behavioral/cognitive performance, and could produce a positive drug test result within a short window of time following exposure. Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke results in absorption of cannabinoids. Secondhand exposure can produce mild subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects Room ventilation ameliorates the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure.",

        "original_reasoning_text": "The news item appears to be a scientific study about the effects of secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke on individuals who do not smoke cannabis themselves. The study found that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke can produce detectable levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine, minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate subjective drug effects, and minor impairment in cognitive performance.  The study also found that room ventilation significantly reduced the levels of exposure among nonsmokers, resulting in much lower levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine, and no subjective effects or impairment in cognitive performance.  The study's findings suggest that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke can result in absorption of cannabinoids, which can lead to minor impairments in cognitive performance and subjective effects. However, the impairments were mild and temporary, and the study did not find any significant long-term effects of secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke.  The study's results are consistent with previous research on the topic and provide further evidence that secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke can have effects on individuals who do not smoke themselves. The study's findings may be useful for policymakers and public health officials who are trying to understand the risks associated with secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke.

We\u2019ve been doing this for six years and it has kept us healthy, even when we know we\u2019ve been exposed to the stomach virus. It\u2019s so easy, you\u2019d be a fool not to try it!      The stomach flu (not truly the \u201cflu\u201d) by nickname, stomach bug, norovirus, puking flu as my kids like to call it\u2026whatever you call it, it\u2019s NOT FUN. Use this simple, effective trick to prevent the stomach flu! If you need home remedies stomach flu has already hit your house perhaps? This works for anyone who is exposed to the stomach virus, but is not yet showing symptoms. We do this daily in our house. Before you waste any more time run over and order everything you need to prevent the stomach virus daily. This is the best home remedies stomach flu post you\u2019ll find and here are the products you need at the best prices. Plus you\u2019ll save yourself a trip to the store where you will likely pick up more germs!  These are the best prices on the products you need plus they\u2019ll ship right to your door. Don\u2019t wait any longer on ordering these. Use them year-round or during peak stomach virus season, it\u2019s up to you!    There is a little-known home remedy to prevent the stomach bug altogether. The trick here is PREVENTION! If you are already feeling symptoms of the stomach flu then this will NOT work. You need to do this BEFORE you get sick. However, if you have been EXPOSED to the stomach bug but aren\u2019t showing symptoms yet then this is the trick you need to prevent yourself from getting sick. The best part? It\u2019s natural and doesn\u2019t involve anything containing chemicals. I am all for natural remedies! Okay, this is going to sound a little \u201cout there\u201d but I\u2019ve tried it and believe me this works! On Monday my hubby came down with the stomach flu. He was puking and felt awful. I think he had norovirus which is a highly contagious stomach flu. Norovirus has been going around and sure enough, a guy he works with had it right before him. Well, of course, he had eaten off my plate that day and I was so worried that the kids and I would all get it too. A friend of mine told me to start drinking grape juice to prevent me from getting sick. The kids and I all started drinking grape juice and here we are 3 days later healthy and well! You may have landed on my page after searching \u201cprevent stomach flu grape juice\u201d. Well, I did some research as there wasn\u2019t much info out there on this. Since writing this post in 2012 we have continued to do this every cold and flu season. The ONLY times we have gotten the stomach virus have been when we QUIT drinking grape juice. This has proved to be very effective for us for the past 6 years.       It turns out there is some science behind this grape juice thing and I did a little research. In order to prevent yourself from getting the stomach flu after you know you have been exposed (taking care of a sick person, being around someone that was sick, etc) you need to start drinking 100% purple Grape Juice, no sugar added, right away BEFORE any symptoms appear. If you are having symptoms then it is too late for this home remedies stomach flu trick and DO NOT drink the grape juice or you will be puking purple and it won\u2019t be pretty! Drink the grape juice three times a day for a few days after being exposed. I have been drinking a juice glass full three times a day and filling the kids sippy cups full three times a day. Yes, this is a lot of sugar but I\u2019d rather consume/give my kids sugar than have them get the stomach flu. The grape juice works by changing the pH in your intestinal tract so that the virus can\u2019t multiply. It also harbors various strong anti-viral chemicals in it. Along with the Vitamin C and anti-oxidants in the juice, it\u2019s supposed to flush and kill the virus and/or severely lessen the symptoms. When you get a stomach virus, it actually isn\u2019t in your stomach, it\u2019s all in your large and small intestines. The effects of what it\u2019s doing to those makes you sick to your stomach (changing the acidity in your stomach). Keeping the pH of the intestines slightly more alkaline is supposed to stop the virus from taking hold and thus making you sick. You can drink the grape juice alone or add in grapefruit seed extract for additional virus-killing benefits. NutriBiotic\u00ae Maximum GSE Liquid Concentrate provides the highest available concentration of Citricidal brand grapefruit seed extract, a natural compound derived from the seed and pulp of grapefruit. The Citricidal seems to be the essential component in helping kill off any stomach virus in your system. I add 2-3 drops to the grape juice each time we drink it. Read the reviews on Amazon and see that this is also good for many, many other uses. It\u2019s not only good for a home remedies stomach flu prevention trick, but so many other things too! So there is the science behind this home remedies stomach flu prevention trick and I\u2019m the living experiment \ud83d\ude42 We are all healthy and have survived having the stomach flu going through our house! I love that grape juice tastes great and is something my kids will willingly drink. So next time you are around someone with the stomach flu start drinking grape juice!      During peak cold and flu season we drink one glass of grape juice a day to prevent the stomach flu. If you know you\u2019ve been exposed to it then up it to three times a day until a few days after the virus is gone from your home. Otherwise, drink a glass daily to prevent the stomach bug from infecting you and your family! In the summer we don\u2019t drink it as we find the stomach bug rarely strikes in summertime.   One thing to note is that you continue to shed the virus for 2 weeks after you get better. That means that even once you are better you can still infect someone else. It is absolutely imperative that anyone that was ill practice good hand washing habits for at least 2 weeks after getting better. This can be tough for little ones so it\u2019s a good idea to stay on top of it and wash hands after toileting or changing diapers. Keep disinfecting commonly used surfaces like door knobs, light switches, fridge handle, etc. And most importantly keep drinking your grape juice!!     223 Comments  Savannah Cooper-Hughes says January 12, 2012 at 11:59 am I am definitely going to keep this in mind this year. Last year DH and I got the norovirus twice! It was so awful, I've never had food poisoning and that was the first time I'd felt that awful. One time I was really pregnant and ended up in L&D with an IV, not pretty!  kevyn says December 25, 2015 at 8:19 am This article is BS. See the following: Grapes and grape juice supply many important nutrients, such as vitamin C and potassium and might also have certain health protective benefits. Grape juice might reduce your risk of developing blood clots, help reduce your LDL cholesterol level, prevent damage to the blood vessels around your heart and help maintain a healthy blood pressure. The antioxidants in grapes and grape juice might also help reduce your risk of heart disease and atherosclerosis. Grapes and grape juice aren\u2019t capable of preventing a stomach virus, however.  Denise says January 3, 2017 at 7:31 pm Thank you! This is utter silliness. We should file it in the basket with essential oils curing anything and rubbing Vicks Vapor Rub on your kids feet to help with their cold. It\u2019s just nonsense that Mom pass around online with zero scientific testing or authority. It\u2019s also a logical fallacy. The absence of an event occurring cannot demonstrate causation of the the absence of the event itself. It\u2019s like saying I brush my hair this morning and whistled a Britney Spears song and they didn\u2019t get a flat tire! So if you brush your hair while whistling Britney Spears song, you won\u2019t get a flat tire!  Susan Stewart says January 11, 2017 at 11:38 am Denise, may I politely ask what credentials you hold to empirically refute thus mother\u2019s experience. I believe there is logical credence in the assertion that the juice changes the pH thus making the gut less conducive for bacterial growth. I base my thinking on documented fact that honey is antimicrobial and promotes healing in wounds. When the Indiana University Wound care center had a difficult time getting my leg ulcers to heal the resorted to medicinal grade of honey and have had great success. Please document your naysaying with facts. MUST HAVE MOM\u2026thank you fir sharing your real life experience. You are not the first place i have heard this. Besides what is the harm in drinking some extra yummy juice???  Christian says January 26, 2017 at 3:14 pm The noroVIRUS isn\u2019t bacteria. The norovirus can be damaged only by bleach (pH=12.6), which is far more alkaline than our intestines can ever get (normal pH=~6-7) without causing hospitalisation. Enough said.  carole donald says February 13, 2017 at 3:36 pm http://www.snopes.com/grape-juice-prevent-stomach-flu/  MG says February 24, 2017 at 12:06 pm These people complaining about \u201ca lack of science\u201d crying foul against this mother and wife are the same people standing outside of the Planned Parenthood celebrating abortion. The modern liberal american has no respect for mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, their children and happy families, churches and strong faith in Christ. Don\u2019t get discouraged by these people. Keep being a great mom and wife. Whatever the science, or \u201clack of science\u201d, behind it, grape juice has been used for hundreds of years to help with stomach ailments. Paul instructed Timothy in 1 Timothy 5:23 \u201cDrink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach\u2019s sake and thine often infirmities.\u201d And no, this is not talking about fermented grape juice, but the sweetest grape juice you ever hung a lip over! This \u201cwine\u201d comes from the Greek word \u03bf\u1f36\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 which means \u201cthe juice of the grape trodden out\u201d similar to \u201cnew wine\u201d or unfermented. Keep doing what works for your family, which is what strong families have been doing for millennia!  Britrney says December 28, 2017 at 8:50 pm Where is the science that proves grape juice prevents flus to begin with. The author just says that she did her research?? What does that even mean?  Barbara says January 16, 2018 at 6:37 pm Thank you Susan! Where does her scientific evidence come from?? I have been the benefactor of healing with honey and pure juices. I like to tell people about it. What\u2019s so bad about that?  Brendan says October 14, 2018 at 7:41 am This has nothing to do with politics or religion mg, it\u2019s just scientific fact that grape juice doesn\u2019t destroy the norovirus. I don\u2019t think Paul was talking about the stomach bug there either.  Bren says January 5, 2019 at 8:51 pm Any real science refutes this. It\u2019s like saying baloney cures cancers. There is no science whatsoever that back it up.  Sarah says January 14, 2019 at 3:51 pm That may be the case but we have found that it works for us every time! I realize that not every remedy is scientifically researched or backed and yet some of them still work. This is one of them for us!  Rachel says January 12, 2017 at 2:29 pm What does it hurt to drink grape juice?  Sarah Must Have Mom says January 16, 2017 at 4:42 pm It doesn\u2019t hurt anything. \ud83d\ude09  Todd the Ph.D says February 27, 2018 at 4:53 pm Because some people believe this utter nonsense, they might not get a vaccination. Or, it may reinforce a prefiliction to do other stupud things other thhings on top of drinking grape juice to prevent the flu. You know, a certain grape juice manufactuer was behind another scam that caused their product to skyrocket. Look up why Communion changed from wine to grape juice. Honestly, get off fb. Your\u2019e all nuts.  Bren says January 5, 2019 at 8:58 pm Nothing, unless you think it\u2019s going to prevent or cure a virus that you neglected to treat properly and die of dehydration.  Dixon says November 4, 2019 at 6:56 pm It has more sugar than a coke! Would you be drinking that much coke? It is unnecessary sugar. Water \u2013 drink water.  Sarah says November 7, 2019 at 8:33 am I don\u2019t drink Coke ever lol because it\u2019s full of toxic garbage. Grape juice does have a lot of naturally occurring sugar yes but I\u2019ll take that over the stomach flu when I\u2019ve been exposed. I definitely advocate for people looking at the amount of sugar in their daily diets and reducing it though \u2013 absolutely. This is a trick that has worked for me ever time I\u2019ve been exposed to the stomach flu though so I\u2019ll continue risking the sugar intake instead of getting the stomach flu. \ud83d\ude42 And yes, drink lots of water daily as your beverage of choice! Unfortunately water doesn\u2019t work to prevent stomach flu though so when exposed \u2013 drink grape juice.  Jennifer says February 7, 2017 at 1:30 pm Hi Denise, I see where your coming from. Im an RN and my daughter had a horrible cough and every night was coughing so much she would vomit. My mother in law insisted we do the vics on the feet. Im not a fan of vics but I agreed. My only request was that my husband buy something all natural. He said do you mind if I try and I said have at it but its not going work. He put the stuff on her feel while she was sleeping and sure enough she stopped the coughing. Now, for the life of me can\u2019t figure out how this works or the science behind it but it did WORK! Sometimes these remedies have science and actions behind them that are more complicated than we understand. Maybe it has something to do with the way the nerves run along the body which maybe interferes with or calms that need to cough. I know that now, every time anyone in my house gets a bad cough I run for that all natural vapo rub and I don\u2019t really care how it works but it does and we all sleep well. So call me crazy but Im a well rested crazy person.  Myna says October 29, 2018 at 11:20 pm Thank you for your input as an RN. I, too, was very sceptical about that so called trick of putting vicks on the bottom of the coughing child\u2019s feet and then putting their socks on. I`m also not a fan of the rub especially NEVER on the chest as it used to be praised for. However, I had a sick coughing foster baby that just couldn\u2019t stop coughing and sleep. So, what could it really hurt? And it WORKED! Multiple times on other babies. I don\u2019t know why \u2013 don\u2019t reckon I need to. I will be drinking grape juice now that I read this. If it works, I will be sooo happy. I hate everything about vomit, the sound, the smell, the appearance \u2013 yes..everything. All of you negative, mean, hateful people \u2013 DON\u2019T drink it if you don\u2019t want to. Don\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want to but do stop being mean. It doesn\u2019t cost anything to be nice. Just be nice.  Sarah says November 1, 2018 at 12:19 pm That\u2019s great to hear! I agree, sometimes we don\u2019t know why something works but it just does! That seems to be the case here too \ud83d\ude42 Love your positive attitude!  Dawn says February 18, 2017 at 9:02 am Some of these do work, especially the Vicks. Essential oils i use everyday and they work wonders. I have been drinking grape juice and haven\u2019t been sick, even with the flu all around me.  Susan Stewart says January 11, 2017 at 11:48 am Kevyn, Why not??? If it is so good with the maladies you cited, why could it NOT work for the one she cited??? I just don\u2019t get some people?????  VA Bullington says January 17, 2017 at 1:25 pm Kevyn, if grape juice can lower cholesterol, reduce risk of blood clots, prevent damage to blood vessels and help to maintain a healthy BP, as you have stated, who are you to avow that it cannot change the pH of the digestive tract to inhibit viral reproduction and harbor antiviral properties? Much of what is known in modern medicine today originated with natural and/or homeopathic remedies. We wouldn\u2019t have aspirin if someone hadn\u2019t chewed on tree bark!  lexie says March 22, 2017 at 2:02 pm wrong!  Angela says September 4, 2017 at 7:58 am Elderberry can though.  Pvclifford says September 13, 2017 at 7:33 am True Essential Oils have been scientifically proven effective. Research Young Living Essential Oils. I use them and they do work \u2013 you have to use regularly for the best benefit.  angie lilly says January 12, 2012 at 5:15 pm my hubby has it right now\u2026i am not showing symptoms but can't drive\u2026darn it\u2026hopefully tomorrow he will feel well enough to go get me some juice and i won't be sick yet\u2026fingers crossed!  won says January 12, 2012 at 6:32 pm Wow\u2026.I've never heard of such a thing! But I'm kind of vomit phobic, so I'm storing this info in my brain.  Jenn says December 31, 2012 at 1:07 pm I\u2019m vomit phobic, too! Like scared to pieces phobic\u2026I just found this site because a bunch of people have come down with the flu and I don\u2019t want it! I\u2019m also storing this for future reference.  Lablover says April 2, 2014 at 6:31 pm I too, am in the puke phobic club. Why do you suppose we are so petrified?  kris says April 25, 2014 at 9:23 pm OMG! So am I! Absolutely PETRIFIED of it happening near me \ud83d\ude41  Tay says December 2, 2014 at 8:28 pm I\u2019m in the same boat! nice to know we\u2019re not alone!  Jen says December 11, 2014 at 11:09 pm I am in the same boat as you guys. when my son started preschool i got anxiety about him getting sick. And i still freak out. I will have to get some grape juice and start doing this cause anything that will help us not puke is awesome in my book. I get elderberry syrup for my boys to take it is a immune boosting medicine look for it at cvs  NLawson says January 10, 2016 at 1:32 am I am scared to death of throwing up also\u2026.like so scared that I like to have my husband in the bathroom with me for moral support lol. I think something is wrong with me. lol  Sarah Must Have Mom says January 12, 2016 at 6:46 pm I like to be alone if I am sick. lol  Virginia Crossin says March 7, 2017 at 3:41 pm I\u2019m not sure why we are so afraid of puking, but I just went out and bought 2 huge bottles, just in case. If it is an old wive\u2019s tale, that\u2019s fine. Juice certainly isn\u2019t bad for you. No great loss if it doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019ll try anything to not throw up!  Sarah Must Have Mom says March 7, 2017 at 8:57 pm There is just nothing fun about vomiting. But you are right, if it works, then that is awesome. If it doesn\u2019t, then you just drank more juice and that is not a bad thing!  Nicole says November 23, 2015 at 7:16 pm I have a vomit phobia too!  Sarah Must Have Mom says November 23, 2015 at 8:16 pm It is the worst.  karenmed409 says January 12, 2012 at 7:53 pm this is new to me! will be keeping more on hand for the little ones.Thank You for sharing.  Sarah says January 12, 2012 at 11:03 pm It's definitely something to keep on hand for the next time you need it! @angie lilly-I hope you don't get it!! Sorry to hear \ud83d\ude41  angie lilly says January 13, 2012 at 6:10 am @sarah: thanks! me too! He is doing much better today. Fever broke at exactly the 24hr mark. Going to get my juice today so fingers crossed!  Bonnie P says January 13, 2012 at 8:36 am just got a part time job doing laundry at a nursing home going to try this as a precaution-btw antiseptic mouthwash kills germs-gargle hourly when you are getting a cold or sore throat  Vanessa Coker says January 17, 2012 at 1:15 pm Makes sense, I like taking Crangrape juice when I'm sick! It saved my life when I had morning sickness!  anonymous says January 17, 2012 at 5:08 pm I have a child now with the stomach flu and I am starting grape juice now. I will let you all know how it goes!  Sarah says January 18, 2012 at 2:53 pm I hope you are all feeling well. Keep us posted on how it works for you all!! -Sarah  Jessica says January 18, 2012 at 10:02 pm This is very interesting and good to know  anonymous says January 19, 2012 at 1:44 pm My child had it yesterday. I accidentally ate from her soup bowl at 5:00 last night. I started drinking grape juice at 6:00. I'll let you know if it works.  ~ Noelle says January 19, 2012 at 4:04 pm Did NOT know\u2026 thanks for the heads up!!!!  anonymous says January 20, 2012 at 9:13 pm I was the one who ate from my daughter's soup bowl the day she was sick with a stomach virus. I am certain I ingested the virus. I drank grape juice \u2013 a large glass 3x daily \u2013 starting within one hour of exposure. It has been 50 hours since exposure, and no symptoms of stomach flu (knock wook). I'm not sure it was the grape juice that spared me, but I'm going to keep it on hand during the winter months just in case!  anonymous says February 18, 2012 at 8:37 pm Yes this has worked for me!! My kids both got a bug within hours of each other \u2013 and everyone around us started getting it \u2013 my parents, my husband, my inlaws. I was determined not to be next so I went online and read about this little trick. I drank a glass of grape juice every few hours like a crazy person for 3-4 days and never got the bug! Now we keep a few bottles on hand just in case\u2026  anonymous says March 12, 2012 at 1:50 am 2:45 am and sitting in bathroom with my 6yr old who has the virus right now. I had it on Friday, and today was the first day i started to feel okay. I hope not to catch it again, and my husband hopes not to catch it at all.  Nicole says November 23, 2015 at 7:18 pm Once you have the virus once, since it\u2019s probably the same time you had, you won\u2019t get it again (not the same exact virus type) because you\u2019re immune to it and your body has already fought it off! \ud83d\ude42  Susan Stewart says January 11, 2017 at 11:44 am Nicole, that is true with some things, but I am not sure about some intestinal maladies. My son has 7 children and great care must be taken to not reinfect\u2026wash wash wash sanitize with bleach and drink grape juice!  anonymous says April 24, 2012 at 5:06 pm My 5 year old had it last Monday\u2026.my 4 yr old had it by the weekend and my 12 year old woke up this morning with it. I have heard drinking green clay also works, but I'm scared as ever and so is my husband! He won't drink the clay, but he will drink the grape juice, so I'll get some and try to spare the rest of us who haven't caught it yet (3) including me.  anonymous says May 15, 2012 at 7:29 pm My son had it Friday, Husband has it today\u2026 Oh how I wish I had grape juice for my daughter and I!!!!!  anonymous says June 10, 2012 at 2:00 pm Yes, this DOES work! I have been doing it for about 5 years now. An old babysitter of mine used to work as a pediatric nurse and she told me about the grape juice trick. Said she didn't know exactly why it worked, but that it had never once let her down. So I tried it, and it worked. Since then, we have had numerous occasions where one of the kids would come in from school saying so and so got sick throwing up today and I was sitting right beside them, etc, etc\u2026 and off to the store I would go to buy grape juice and they would never get it. The few times that one of us has gotten it, the grape juice has always kept the rest of the family members from getting it too.  Kelly says October 10, 2012 at 7:40 pm Started doing this a year and a half ago. \ud83d\ude42  Kim says October 26, 2012 at 12:29 pm I just came across this, and I too discovered this little secret around the same time last winter. Two of my three kids came down with the flu on the same night, so I raced out to buy all of the grape juice I could get my hands on. Nobody else got sick! We continued to drink it until the spring time\u2026.. I am already stocking up for this year! It totally works!  Pat says October 26, 2012 at 12:29 pm My brother got exposed to this horrible virus and i felt so bad. Anyway i went and bought grape juice and none of the 4 other family members not including my brother were all fine it is amazing how great such a drink can prevent such a horrible virus  Shannon says October 26, 2012 at 12:30 pm We are trying it now! My husband came down with it this past Monday AM and my daughter and I have been drinking 3 glasses or more if we can handle it a day since. We are on day 3 now and no bug so far. Of course I did plenty of washing down my home where needed with bleach and water. Mostly bleach where it could be handled , like in the bathroom. Thanks for sharing this wonderful preventative! And thank you to Welch\u2019s!  Tina says October 26, 2012 at 12:30 pm Hi there. My hubby had the stomach virus on Friday night. (today is Monday) So, Saturday morning i went bought the Welch\u2019s grape juice after reading a pin on pinterest about it. My daughter and I have been both drinking it 2-3 times daily. 6-8 oz at a time. So far so good. Disinfected my house all weekend. Cleaned everything!! Praying the juice works its magic since it is my daugter\u2019s 4th birthday tomorrow and her party is on Saturday! Fingers Crossed. Hope it works for me like it did for you guys! Thanks for sharing!  Julie says November 1, 2012 at 4:10 pm My son got sick last Friday with the worst stomach virus I have ever seen in our house, ended up in the ER. I am the only one in the family who has been diligent about drinking the juice 3 times a day since. No one else has it so far, but I for one feel much better knowing I have this new trick in my corner! I will be keeping this around the house for sure. ANYTHING to keep from getting the dreaded stomach virus! I hate them! I wish I had known to try this idea years ago.  Sarah says November 3, 2012 at 12:23 am I\u2019m glad to hear everyone else is doing well! Stay healthy \ud83d\ude42  Bridget says November 1, 2012 at 11:25 pm I wish i would have found this on Sunday, my whole house has been infected with this horrible virus since. My son started on sunday night and got better over the days, and is now sick again. I didnt think it was possible to get it immediately after it was gone. Im buying Grape juice in the morning. Im keeping grape juice in stock from now on.  Sarah says November 3, 2012 at 12:22 am Ugh sorry to hear that Bridget! Just make sure they aren\u2019t already showing symptoms when you start the grape juice otherwise they\u2019ll be puking purple and that stains! It has to be started before you show symptoms. Hope you all feel better soon! We keep a stockpile of grape juice on hand. Glad you\u2019ll know for next time. I too first heard of this when our house was infected!  Nikki says November 14, 2012 at 6:57 am We started the grape juice just this winter and so far nothing! Not even queasy feelings.we only drink one glass a day and then up it if my daughter was in contact with someone who was sick or feeling sick! I love that this works so well!  Julie says November 15, 2012 at 1:34 pm Just googled what to do when kids exposed to stomach flu\u2026 And I am RUNNING to Safeway to buy grape juice! Let\u2019s hope it works, I have four children under nine and am pregnant \ud83d\ude09 thank you!!!!  emily says November 18, 2012 at 5:57 pm what about white grape juice? I\u2019m not a fan of the purple grape juice because of the fact that it can stain. My husband is sick and i don\u2019t want me or my 8 month old son to get it. I have him qua rented in a back bedroom and have started the babe and I on white grape juice. Any indication that the white grape juice wouldn\u2019t produce the same results?  VA Bullington says January 17, 2017 at 1:32 pm Emily, our family has always used Welch\u2019s white grape juice. Until now, I never knew the purple worked too.  Jodi tallmon says December 17, 2018 at 8:31 pm I love white grape juice\u2026not the purple kind so much. Has the white really kept your family free of stomach viruses? If so. how much do you drink?  Sarah says December 20, 2018 at 6:44 pm We have only used the purple and I don\u2019t know if the white works or not.  Bob says November 21, 2012 at 12:23 am I\u2019m 45, and I\u2019d like to offer a tip that I have used before with great success, a \u201clast ditch\u201d cure when the virus actually wakes you up at night. First, here\u2019s how to tell if you\u2019re going to have it that night: is the food you ate today sitting in your stomach like a rock and not digesting? Even worse, are you also experiencing disscomfort like your stomach is trying to expand? Then start preparing, because you\u2019re going to have an unpleasant evening. If a strange sensation wakes yo up out of the blue (especially if you\u2019re a sound sleeper), then \u201cit\u2019s going to happen\u201d. Get to the bathroom NOW. And hopefully you have already prepared as described below. Here\u2019s what I do: When this garbage is making its way through your home, keep a powerful summertime fan in the bathroom. You\u2019ll notice that right before you vomit, you get all weak, hot and sweaty. Get to the bathroom quickly, immediately strip down to underwear, and crank that fan up and freeze yourself. And I mean get yourself shivering, as quickly as you can. Kick that fan into hurricane mode. It MIGHT not keep you from having some severe diarrhea to pass this garbage, but it is an extremely strong remedy to stop nausea, even in stomach flu situations. I discovered this trick one day when I was about to get sick on the bus in the morning on the way to work in Seattle (how embarrassing that would have been). I BARELY got off in time, I stepped off that bus a weak, limp noodle of sweat and misery. I immediately took my coat off, I was all hot and sweaty, and I was just about to vomit, but it was freezing out, lots of snow. That blast of cold air was the most welcome relief I had ever experienced, and it took only a few minutes for the sensation of nausea to completely vanish. I didn\u2019t put my heavy winter coat back on until I was good and shivering. I must have looked like a freak to people, but it totally worked. 1/2 hour later, I got back on the next bus and actually went to work (which I probably shouldn\u2019t have done). Key point is that the more shockingly cold you can make it, the more effective it is. Hope this helps someone out there like it helps me.  ginger says January 17, 2013 at 10:54 am Great point Bob! I\u2019m a MAJOR vomit phobic!! I\u2019ve learned a trick that is simular. Put an ice cold rag on your stomach and neck when you feel like throwing up. You don\u2019t vomit. I\u2019ve done this with my kids since they were babies. They are now 16 and 13 and ask for it when they feel like throwing up. When they were little they hated it though. It was just so cold. Once, my daughter was about 8 and she was like, get that thing off me. So, I too it off her and she threw up. After that, she asked for it.  Sarah says January 24, 2013 at 5:53 pm Wow that is definitely a trick I will keep up my sleeve! Hopefully we don\u2019t have to use it anytime soon!  Carly says April 15, 2013 at 6:41 am I can atest to this as well. Whenever I feel like vomiting is inevitable I will grab a bowl of cold water, and throw as much ice in it as possible. I then put my face in it when that \u201cit\u2019s gonna happen!!!\u201d feeling comes. It works!  Eima Nnyl says January 15, 2014 at 7:36 am I can also attest to the cold feeling keeping you from vomiting. If I feel like I\u2019m going to throw up, and I know that\u2019s the day it\u2019s going to happen, if I\u2019m home, I strip down and jump into an ice cold shower. Shocks the feeling right out of me. I\u2019m an emetaphobic which I\u2019m guessing many of you dont realize that that is the scientific term for someone afraid to throw up. So I do what I can to not puke. My daughter got a virus a year and a half ago and I started feeling like I was going to vomit the same day but didn\u2019t because I ran around half naked with ice cold wash cloths on me and fans blasted everywhere. I\u2019m definitely heading out in a few minutes to pick up a couple bottles of grape juice. I don\u2019t know if my daughter or I have been exposed or not but I\u2019m going to be drinking this three times a day as much as I can until the virus isn\u2019t going around anymore.  Rebecca says January 17, 2014 at 1:26 pm Definitely agree with you, Bob. I have stripped down to lay on the cold bathroom floor numerous times. I\u2019ve also had to strip down (as much as possible w/out offending) on flights when I got nauseous. A little embarrassing, but worth it not to yack all over a stranger! Will definitely be adding the fan, the bowl of ice water and cold dish rag.  Todd says November 25, 2012 at 10:08 pm You said you did some research and there is science behind this remedy- can you post the sources you found from your research? I am trying to research this myself and have found nothing so far. Thanks!  Kyra says December 24, 2012 at 9:42 am Yes! It works and so does cranberry juice!!!!  Dale Larsen says January 3, 2013 at 1:13 pm I am one of the biggest skeptics of home rememdies\u2026 but I must admit this totally worked. It has fended the stomach flu off twice now for the family and me while someone in the house had the virus. As a working dad it really helps to not have sick days and to know your family is not puking at home.  Sarah says January 24, 2013 at 5:54 pm I too am a skeptic so I was thrilled when it worked! Glad it has saved you and your family! My hubby has no sick days so it was always really tough when it made it\u2019s way through the house!  Tamika says January 1, 2015 at 10:37 am My mother has been treating my family with this as long a I can remember. We have not had any major illnesses. I don\u2019t get sick nor do my family members. No one in my immediate family has every had the flu\u2026.not my parents, my siblings, children nor myself . Sarah has definitely provided good information. I am a homepathic physician and I recommend it to my patients all the time. Even if you\u2019re feeling run down, I would start taking it. Majority of the time, it will prevent it from becoming an actual cold. Just be sure to get proper rest and eat a healthy diet. Avoid things that might make your body\u2019s pH more acidic. Disease thrives in an acidic body. Make sure to get your fruits and vegetables in daily, especially leafy greens. If you\u2019re not a vegetable person, an excellent preventive measure would be JuicePlus. Back to the original topic, the antioxidant properties come from the resveratrol in the grapes that gives them their color. Blueberries are also a powerful superfood. They contain anthocyanins, that give them their color. They both have many health benefits. It\u2019s harder to find blueberry juice and it\u2019s a little more expensive. Here\u2019s to a Happy and Healthy New Year!  meg.leigh says January 3, 2013 at 9:23 pm Does this work only with 100% grape juice or can it be grape juice with some other kind of juice? I had to get combination juice tonight, they didn\u2019t have anything else. But I can find 100% grape juice tomorrow if necessary.  Sarah says January 4, 2013 at 9:25 am It must be 100% purple grape juice. Any other kind will not work for this.  Jill says January 8, 2013 at 12:01 pm My step son came home with the stomach flu last night from school, was up all night throwing up. I HATE stomach viruses\u2026..anything but that. I have 3 other kids and really can\u2019t afford to have them or myself and husband get it. I sure hope this grape juice thing works!  Sarah says January 24, 2013 at 5:55 pm Did it work for you Jill?  Lauren says January 9, 2013 at 11:35 pm I am mom- I have a 14 yr old, 16 yr old and 2 yr old. All three and my husband have been a victim of the belly plague this past week and I am still free and clear\u2026it works.  Sarah says January 24, 2013 at 5:56 pm Thanks for sharing Lauren \ud83d\ude42 Stay well!  Karen says January 23, 2013 at 4:23 pm I\u2019ve done this many times with great success. We only drink one cup per day per person.  Sarah says January 24, 2013 at 5:57 pm So you think one cup is effective enough? One cup is sure better than three lol.  Jessica says January 25, 2013 at 4:32 pm Does it have to be Welches or can you substitute with a generic brand?  Sarah says January 29, 2013 at 2:08 pm It must be 100% purple grape juice, nothing added, no blends. As long as that\u2019s the case I think another brand would work the same.  jos says February 13, 2013 at 4:03 pm What about if it says from concentrate with added 120% vitamin C ???  jos says February 13, 2013 at 4:05 pm All i could find was welches 100% grape juice no sugar added but 120% added vitamin C and it says helps support a healthy heart. Will that work???  VA Bullington says January 17, 2017 at 1:40 pm Jessica, I tried the store brand with less than stellar results, so now it\u2019s always Welch\u2019s for me.  Jessica says January 25, 2013 at 4:36 pm Also, how long do you drink the grape juice after exposure?  Sarah says January 29, 2013 at 2:09 pm When you know you\u2019ve been exposed you need to drink three glasses a day for a few days until the bug has passed (if you are taking care of the sick person) and the house has been disinfected then drink one glass a day for prevention in the future. 3 glasses a day for known exposure though. If you aren\u2019t living with the sick person I would drink 3 glasses a day for 3 days.  Lindsay says January 26, 2013 at 1:15 pm My son came down with the bug around 11 last night, heading out to get grape juice now! Hope it works! I have a severe phobia of vomit. I\u2019ll will let you know in a few days!  Sarah says January 29, 2013 at 2:06 pm I hope you are doing well. I\u2019m working on an update to this post now. You can also drink one glass a day to prevent the stomach flu before being exposed. If you know you\u2019ve been exposed drink 3 glasses a day for a few days until it has passed and you\u2019ve cleaned the house for any remaining germs!  Lindsay says January 29, 2013 at 2:10 pm Hey! I\u2019m still healthy! Felt a little ill last night but nothing other than that. And let me tell you I have bleached, and rebleached, and rebleached all my floors Nd hard surfaces and used Lysol on beds and carpets! I\u2019m glad I found this blog!  anonymous says January 31, 2013 at 1:26 am So, are you suppose to drink the one with no sugar? You said get sugar free or it won\u2019t work, but then you went on to say u made your kids drink 3 glasses a day, and that was a lot of sugar for them???  aj says January 14, 2014 at 9:47 pm not sugar free- she said \u201cno sugar added\u201d  Ashleigh says January 31, 2013 at 4:14 am My brother started vomiting a few days ago and the rest of the house thought they were okay after he started to feel better. Well tonight my other brother vomited and am paranoid beyond belief about catching this! It seems to be spreading \ud83d\ude41 and absolutely HATE vomiting I can\u2019t take it! I\u2019m kinda upset that my mom convinced me it was okay to take my face mask off when it\u2019s not! thanks for this post I will try this and report back.  J says February 1, 2013 at 4:05 pm What are the symptoms when it is too late exactly? Like just feeling achy or actually getting sick? Thanks so much for posting this!  Erin says February 11, 2013 at 1:26 pm I am waiting for my hubby to get home from work so I can go to the store and get a few jugs of grape juice. My 4yo started vomiting last night, and I DO NOT want my 7yo, my 15mo old and ESPECIALLY not my husband to come down with this. Anyone know if white grape juice works? I fear it may be too late to prevent my other kids from getting it, and Id like to avoid purple vomit stains on the carpet if at all possible!  Sarah says February 12, 2013 at 11:13 am It MUST be the 100% purple grape juice, nothing else added. If your kids are displaying ANY symptoms of being sick then don\u2019t use it! If they are symptom free then start 3 glasses a day. Hope you all stay well!  jos says February 14, 2013 at 8:42 am Does it matter if the juice is refrigerated or not?  Kenny says March 14, 2015 at 11:14 pm If it\u2019s opened then yes it needs to be in the frig says it right on the bottle if not opened then no  Mike says February 21, 2013 at 9:01 am My daughter works at a retirement facility and came home 2 days ago telling us how so many of the old people were being quarantined and some were sent to the hospital from exposure to norovirus, That was enough to freak me out knowing all to well that my daughter will bring it home . Sure enough, the next morning she woke up staring into the white porcelin throne waking us all up. She said that the State Dept. of Health measured the height of this contamination as very severe and is airborne. Now I\u2019m really freaking out, found your suggestion and started a regimen of 3 glasses per day of 100% pure red grape juice. So far (day 2) so good. My wife and son are all on board. Thanks for the tip!  Tami says March 3, 2013 at 12:54 pm Hey, can I substitute WHITE grape juice for the purple or is there some magic in the stuff that stains?  Sarah says March 11, 2013 at 3:11 pm The magic is in the lovely, staining purple stuff \ud83d\ude42 Sorry!  Amanda Self says March 6, 2013 at 4:10 pm Me and my family have been doing this for several years and it has worked wonders for us..When we have been exposed to the virus we drink a glass of welches 100% grapejuice for several nights..hope this works for others like it has us  Angela Layton says March 25, 2013 at 11:39 pm My husband just got sick a few hours ago. He looks so bad!! I am really afraid of catching it and giving it to my three other kids. I ran out and got the Welch\u2019s grape juice at midnight after seeing the posts. Still a little skeptical but giving my 100 percent to trying it. I will post back after a few days. I pray it works. Thanks to everyone who responded as well!  Chelsea McCarthy says March 25, 2013 at 11:48 pm So tonight i just happen to come across this post while googling about the stomach flu. I immediately went out and bought 2 bottles of the welch\u2019s 100% grape juice and started drinking it as soon as got in my truck after buying it lol. i been exposed now for a day going on two days. My boyfriend came down with it Sunday afternoon and its now Tuesday morning but it is almost 1 am. i really hope this grape juice works because i start my job tomorrow on wednesday and i would hate to have to call out. i am extremely afraid of vomit and its one of my phobias lol so i pray i dont getvit!  jamie braun says March 31, 2013 at 7:00 am my gosh, the past 2 years the stomach flu has ravenged our house. my daughter brought it home from daycare. my nephew goes to the same daycare & he brought it home too, so my sisters family was sick too! i have never heard of this grape juice home remedy! thanks for the tip! i\u2019ll try it next time  Whitney Wingerd -MWS (@WhitneyMWS) says April 11, 2013 at 5:50 pm Totally trying this! We drink a ton of the Welch\u2019s WHITE grape juice but will try and purple next time the stomach bug comes around and see how we fare!  Amie says June 25, 2013 at 12:45 pm I have read this entire post and understand that 100% grape juice is the way to go. My 11 y.o. had the bug Friday and Saturday and now my 2 y.o. had it through night but has nausea meds from a previous incident. I don\u2019t want my husband, daughter or myself to get it have started the 3 glasses a day regimen. My daughter dislikes it due to having reflux but likes cran/grape since it\u2019s not as bitter. Does anyone know if this still works the same?  Mel says August 5, 2013 at 2:28 pm There is NO such thing as the \u201cstomach flu\u201d!! The term\u201dflu\u201d is short for influenza which is a respiratory virus! So you mean to tell me you have a stomach respiratory virus?!? Nope! You either have the norovirus, food poisoning, and intestinal virus it bacterial infection.  Sarah says August 6, 2013 at 11:55 am I am well aware that the stomach flu is not actual influenza but I am a Registered Nurse and am well versed in health and it\u2019s terms unlike the general population. The general public refers to a stomach virus as the \u201cstomach flu\u201d and hence I am speaking in lay mans terms. Take it at face value. I\u2019m not here to debate why the public calls it the stomach flu.  Dianna says January 23, 2014 at 4:59 am AMEN LOL also RN  Sally says January 7, 2014 at 11:09 am Seriously??? That is what you choose to write about? Lol  Chev says August 6, 2013 at 9:08 am Is it the same effect when I eat grapefruit instead of drinking grapefruit juice.?  Sarah says August 6, 2013 at 11:56 am For this to work you must drink purple GRAPE juice and not grapefruit juice. I do also add grapefruit seed extract to my grape juice when I drink it. I don\u2019t know if eating a grapefruit would be concentrated enough like the extract is.  Jim M. says May 29, 2019 at 3:06 am This is some helpful anecdotal information about the use of grape juice to counter the ill effects of a stomach virus. But since some here have also posted about the drinking of grapefruit juice, I thought some cautionary advice is in order. Some people need to avoid grapefruit juice altogether, as it interferes with the absorption of certain life-sustaining medications, such as some blood pressure-lowering, cardiovascular, cholesterol-lowering, and HIV medications. Also some anti-allergic, anti-impotence, and psychopharmacological drugs are not to be taken with grapefruit juice. But one should ask one\u2019s physician if one prefers to drink grapefruit juice, as sometimes alternative medications may be prescribed which will not have negative interactivity with the consumption of grapefruit juice. Here is a list of several medications which shouldn\u2019t be taken if one has consumed grapefruit juice\u2013.statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs): lovastatin (Mevacor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), simvastatin (Zocor, Vytorin). Other statins such as fluvastatin (Lescol), pravastatin (Pravachol), and rosuvastatin (Crestor) have little or no interaction with grapefruit juice.), Antihistamines: fexofenadine (Allegra). Some type of calcium channel blockers (blood pressure drugs): felodipine (Plendil), nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia). Certain psychiatric drugs: buspirone (BuSpar), triazolam (Halcion), carbamazepine (Tegretol), diazepam (Valium), midazolam (Versed), sertraline (Zoloft). Some immunosuppressants: cyclosporine (Neoral), tacrolimus (Prograf). Certain pain medications: methadone. The impotence drug (erectile dysfunction): sildenafil (Viagra). Some HIV medication: saquinavir (Invirase). Some antiarrhythmics: amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone).  Kimberly says September 6, 2013 at 1:49 pm After hearing about this from a friend, I decided to \u201cresearch.\u201d While it\u2019s true there is no \u201creal\u201d science behind this yet, out of the hundreds and hundreds of testimonials I read from people who have tried it, I didn\u2019t see ONE person say that it didn\u2019t work. I\u2019m an emetophobic to the core, and I often find it hard to function due to the fear. We have 5 children, and inevitably someone gets a stomach virus once a year no matter how hard I try to prevent it. Last week, my 1 year old threw up ALL over me in the middle of my parents dining room next to the table where we were going to have lunch. We were all very much exposed. He had a fever, and stomach cramps as well so I have no doubt he was contagious. We went home and immediately began this grape juice trick. It has been 5 days now, and NO ONE ELSE is sick!!!!!! You know with a 1 year old that it\u2019s impossible to keep them away from everyone and clean up perfectly (even though I try), but even with my efforts, my husband and I were certainly very exposed being the ones caring for him. He did only throw up the one time, not at our home, so I hope the trick works as well when there is more exposure as well. I am just over the moon with this! We have never been able to keep a \u201ctrue\u201d stomach bug from going around to at least one other child. I am just amazed!!! I do have a question. Even with all the comments I\u2019m a bit confused. Stomach bugs can continue to shed for up to 2 weeks, as well as be on surfaces for that long. So do you continue to take the 3 glasses a day for 2 weeks to be sure? After only 5 days I\u2019m getting a bit tired of the grape juice, and the sugar content is quite a lot for this sugar conscious family, not to mention the cost of that much grape juice for a family of 7! But if it needs to be done for 2 weeks, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. LOL!  Bill says October 21, 2013 at 11:30 pm I hate to burst everyone\u2019s bubble, but the advocacy of this remedy is questionable. I did as instructed to the T and still contracted the virus in full. I may offer a possible explanation: the people who are worried enough about catching it to follow this remedy (myself included) are the same people who will make an extra effort to wash their hands often. Hand washing is the best way to prevent getting a stomach virus, but even then you are not guaranteed to avoid it. Stomach viruses are very resilient and it seems that all you can really do is wait them out. It was a great idea and I wish it had worked, but unfortunately it did not for me. 10 points on the post though!  Suzanne says February 24, 2015 at 7:15 am I\u2019m skeptical as well. I have not had the stomach bug, even when my son has gotten it. I believe it\u2019s because I wash my hands & keep the sick child \u201cquarantined\u201d in this room (haha). I also remind my kids to wash hands periodically, on a daily basis. Especially, when they get home from school. My son, however, seems to be the one who gets sick the most. He\u2019s in kindergarten & he still rubs his eyes & nose, a lot. My 8 year old has not caught anything from him over the years. She also will not share drinks, bites of food, silverware etc. I did see a note about the juice giving your \u201csystem\u201d higher alkalinity v acidity \u2013 and was thinking that could be accomplished with change in diet, rather than just chugging grape juice, if that\u2019s what people think is helpful.  helen says October 23, 2013 at 7:12 am I have bought 99.9 % reconstituted grape juice (purple)thats all I could find will this work  Nicole says October 28, 2013 at 8:21 pm I\u2019m chugging the purple stuff as we speak. I\u2019m a middle school teacher with over 100 students so these things spread like wildfire, last year it hit me like a truck, I swear I was exposed at 7 am and by 7 pm I was already coming down with symptoms. Now two teachers right next to me have it and I am a server vomit-phobe and have a full on nervous break down at the thought. Grape juice, handwashing, emetrol and fingers crossed.  Canada says December 3, 2013 at 11:38 pm My Chinese medicine dr told me that an old Chinese dr told him to boil vinegar when bugs are going around the house. Especially the stomach bugs. I usually boil it at night when my five kids are sleeping so no one is complaining about the smell. The vinegar settles on all the surfaces and helps to kill the bugs. Couple this with the grape juice and it\u2019s all good!  Kellie says December 6, 2013 at 5:01 pm This TOTALLY works. My boyfriend woke up one morning really sick with the stomach flu. I am terrified of throwing up, so I drink a glass of grape juice during the winter every day anyway, but I started drinking a little more when I found out he was sick. We had been kissing the night before so I was completely positive the bug was in me. I was worried about when it would hit ALL weekend, but because of the grape juice, It never did!! Drink a glass every morning for breakfast. Although sugary, it\u2019s full of vitamin C and it gets your blood sugar back to normal after sleeping at night, all way giving you peace of mind! Definitely recommend it!  Lyndal says December 11, 2013 at 5:42 am In Australia it\u2019s Berri Grape Juice, but it works! Since my youngest son started kindergarten, I was freaked about him picking up all the nasty bugs, most especially the stomach flu. I started giving all 3 of my kids a large glass of grape juice every day with dinner; they also have 2 drops of oil of oregano a day as well. Anyway, long story short, 3 outbreaks of stomach flu went through my son\u2019s kindy class and he was the only one to escape it. His teacher told me he must have an iron stomach.  John says December 20, 2013 at 12:51 am I am a 56-year old man. My experience with grape juice is just the opposite. If I drink an 8 oz. glass of grape juice in the evening, within six hours, I will experience vomiting, diarrhea, gastric upset, low blood sugar, and all sorts of problems. I will be vomiting and having diarrhea all night and into the next morning. I first noticed this when I was 5 or 6 years old, and then laid off the grape juice. I forgot all about it, and started drinking grape juice in my early 20\u2019s, and I began to experience these symptoms. It took me awhile to connect it to the grape juice, but when I did, and stopped drinking it, the problem went away.  Sarah says January 2, 2014 at 3:26 pm Perhaps you are experiencing a food allergy or intolerance to grape juice as that certainly isn\u2019t a normal reaction to drinking a glass of grape juice. I would stay away from it in your case.  Steph says December 22, 2013 at 1:12 am I just babysat tonight and right as I was leaving one kid got sick and they told me his brother has the virus other day. I, being absolutely petrified of vomit, ran to get this. I\u2019ve been doing this for a year but never truly been exposed to the virus, except for tonight. The kid was all over me. Praying this works! Especially with christmas around the corner.  John Gardner says December 30, 2013 at 1:21 pm 1 Tim. 5:23 \u200a\u200a Drink no longer water, but use a little wine [grape juice] for thy stomach\u2019s sake and thine often infirmities.  Sarah says January 2, 2014 at 3:26 pm Awe great verse and one that I wasn\u2019t aware of! Thanks for sharing.  Lena says January 23, 2014 at 10:42 am Worth a try! Everyone PLEASE remember that intestinal viruses are most contagious during and after symptoms! The schools usually say 24 hours, but the person is HIGHLY contagious for at least 48 hours after the last episode d vomiting or diarrhea, even if they feel fully recovered.  Tammy says January 23, 2014 at 4:17 pm I tried it and it totally works!!!! I\u2019m a believer. My husband got the flu, bad, and we were all in contact with him the same morning that his symptoms suddenly appeared. We all started drinking grape juice (myself and my 3 kids) for about 4 days after that and none of us got the flu. It\u2019s been about 3 weeks and no symptoms\u2026 I\u2019m sure they would have shown up by now if we were going to get sick. This is a trick that I will have with me forever\u2026 I\u2019ve already shared it with many friends and family.  Jennifer says January 24, 2014 at 11:11 am You can increase your alkalinity to your stomach without drinking a bunch of sugar. Try alka-seltzer\u2026..sugar actually inhibits your immune system for up to four hours from working to rid your body of any bugs because of the inflammatory response your body goes through in relation to sugars. Also, increasing your vitamin C, zinc and vitamin D will keep you from getting it. Don\u2019t forget if you supplement with vitamin D you must eat with it for absorption. Don\u2019t think because you drink milk you are going to have your bases covered either, milk is high in sugar as well.  M mama says November 19, 2014 at 5:28 pm I usually avoid all sugar including juice and honey but I will gladly break this habit in order to prevent the stomach flu. Throwing up and diarrhea aren\u2019t good for you either  Helena says February 24, 2014 at 11:59 am Now I know why my husband and I haven\u2019t gotten sick when the flu has whipped through our house. We drink red wine everyday: a glass after he comes home from work and one or two at dinner. \ud83d\ude42  Judy says February 28, 2014 at 11:04 pm Oh my goodness!! I\u2019ve never heard of this before! And it seems like when anything goes around \u2013 my 4 kids and I get it.. definitely trying this \ud83d\ude42 will let ya know how it goes the next time we are all on the verge of getting sick! LOL  Candice says March 13, 2014 at 9:20 am My aunt who grew up in the 20\u2019s always made homemade grape juice and any time any of the family had an upset stomach she would give this to us. She always said that it settled your stomach and she was right.  Charissa says April 4, 2014 at 2:00 am My daughter came down with the bug at 11PM. It\u2019s now 3AM and I have just read this article. Unfortunately I cannot run out now, but I did read the one comment about using apple cider vinegar with the mother, which thankfully I have, so I took a big sip of it and then added a bit of it to my water bottle. I\u2019m hoping this will help keep me well to take care of her. How soon does one come down with this after exposure, generally? My poor daughter, 6, has thrown up at least 6 times. I\u2019m making sure she drinks water and/or Gatorade and/or my melaleuca mineral electrolyte sports drink after each time, but I can tell there\u2019s not much liquid left in her. Maybe a trip to hospital sooner??  Whitney says April 24, 2014 at 1:38 am My nephew threw up all over me about 3 hours ago. Stepdad bringing me a grape juice hopefully it will work. Will post back within a few days to let yall know thanks for the advice  erin elizabeth says May 24, 2014 at 12:33 am I\u2019d just try an organic brand instead. I\u2019m kinda picky about drinking heavy pesticides.  curious researcher says June 25, 2014 at 12:37 pm Since the grape seed extract (note: that\u2019s not grapefruit seed) was shown (Dr. Dan Li, Belgium) to prevent some sort of binding to the cells (by Norovirus\u2019 closest lab virus), there has GOT to be a connection between the substance in grape seeds and grape juice. The thing is, if this virus goes straight to the colon and sets up camp (is this correct?) before it ever causes symptoms, it makes it difficult to know when to start a preventative, unless the person is aware that they may have been exposed and can begin their assault on this little invader. My internet research has been limited and it can be difficult knowing when someone says \u201cthis doesn\u2019t work\u201d or \u201cthat doesn\u2019t work\u201d whether they tried it after the viral proliferation began (ie after symptoms hit) or whether they started well in advance of the virus\u2019 entry. The thing that seems to consistently work is charcoal tabs (activated carbon). People use these pills for gas. It filters a few things from water (and apparently is safe, since Brita claims that the black water on the first pass is drinkable). I guess one concern would be someone who takes several pills and they get an intestinal blockage. Suspending it in water may help prevent that. Keeping the body well-hydrated all of the time will probably help, too. A word of caution: the charcoal could adsorb medications (although no medication is going to stay down if someone is vomiting). The trick to charcoal must be to start taking it at the first sign of minor nausea or diarrhea. Once a virus starts doing its thing, it can be really hard to contain, especially since it\u2019s so far down the \u201cpipes\u201d. It goes viral and is hard to rein in. I\u2019m not sure if it would diminish the carbon\u2019s actions (or not) if it were dispersed in grape juice but it would definitely look more palatable. One website I ran across, mentions 6 drops of Lugol\u2019s iodine, spread over a day (not long-term, for the sake of the thyroid) but I haven\u2019t found anyone who is certain it works. Many years ago, I used to eat raw oysters by the dozens. I eventually got hold of a bad set and I almost bit the dust from vomiting too frequently in a short period. I presumed it was a bacteria but I\u2019ve read that oysters are very prone to carrying the virus because of sewage pollution exposure. Yes, vomit can be deadly. I can\u2019t count the number of times I thought I would have to start my late husband\u2019s heart. He took very high-dose chemo and got deathly weak from all the vomiting. It\u2019s a valid phobia, folks.  curious researcher says June 25, 2014 at 12:53 pm Details of the grapeseed extract experiment. (copy and paste into Google, I don\u2019t want to post a live link): wellnessresources.com/studies/grape_seed_extracts_anti-viral_activity/ From reading this, I wouldn\u2019t think it would be a good idea to consume milk or any other dairy product close to when the grapeseed is taken. That might apply to the grape juice, too.  Kathryn says December 26, 2015 at 1:03 pm Thank you for this link. It helps.  Kristina says July 31, 2014 at 3:12 am Worked for me! My hubby got really sick and was throwing up all night from a stomach bug. Our kids had just been sick with laryngitis so I was determined for them and myself not to get it so I gave us all 100% grape juice (a couple big glasses a day) and we never got it! I also drank apple cidar vinegar in my water as well since I heard that helps. Anyhow great natural remedy!!! Thanks for sharing!!!  Brisky says September 6, 2014 at 12:50 pm I\u2019m a HUGE phobic of vomiting! :'( I\u2019m only 15 but I haven\u2019t threw up since I was 8! That day I cried as hell after throwing up\u2026 :'( Anyway, after reading this, my mom bought a big bottle of Welch\u2019s grape juice \ud83d\ude00 I drank a cup of it! ^_^ Hopefully, it\u2019ll help! \ud83d\ude00 I\u2019ll start drinking it everyday, just a cup. Because I think 3 cups is too much \ud83d\ude41  Chan K says November 10, 2014 at 11:41 pm The bible give this advice 1 Timothy 5:23 \u201cDrink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach\u2019s sake and thine often infirmities.\u201d Funny how the world turns a blind eye to God\u2026.and btw wine is not alcholic wine that we drink today, that is pure deception, whenever the bible mentions wine, it is talking about Grape Juice or fruit of the vine  Monica says December 10, 2014 at 3:19 pm Omg thank you so much for this info. A week later and I have still not caught the stomach bug and I get every time my daughter gets it but this time I didn\u2019t get it.  Sabrina says January 15, 2015 at 10:32 pm It Works! My husband got it first and as soon as he vomited, I headed to the store and started drinking grape juice. After making it through 72 hours symptom free, my son woke up puking. I thought for sure I would catch it, but surprisingly enough it\u2019s been a week and a half, no sickness for me. Now, I Will say that I also made sure to wash my hands a lot, so that certainly contributed to my health. But I am going to keep on drinking a glass a day for prevention, but if I know someone has had it around me, I will up my intake by three glasses a day for sure. I am writing to let everyone know that it did work for me. When I was reading all the blogs I was doubtful but desperate. But in my case I\u2019m happy to report no puking for this mama.  Candy says January 24, 2015 at 1:24 am THIS IS AWESOME!!! I found this while hubby and I had the stomach virus. We got it back to back!! Just as I was BARELY beginning to get over it, it hit him. Having a 2 year old I was TERRIFIED of her coming down with it \u2013 little ones dehydrate so quickly and this bug was a particularly HORRID one! I IMMEDIATELY started her on grape juice (and went through an entire can of lysol spray in 36 hours \u2013 lol). PRAISE GOD she never came down with it!! I\u2019ve since recommended it to SEVERAL other parents whose children have come home with it \u2013 guess what???? Only ONE reported that her other child got it \u2013 but she\u2019d already been experiencing some symptoms. However, no one else in the house got it. Many people have been spared the misery of that HORRID virus \u2013 simply by me sharing this post!! I wish I would have known about this when I was working as a CNA\u2026when the stomach virus hits a nursing home, it\u2019s all over!!! I am SO grateful I know this now with a child. Grape juice is now part of our daily routine \u2013 especially right now when the virus is so active everywhere!! The little one calls it her tummy medicine \ud83d\ude42 THANK YOU AGAIN \u2013 THANK YOU THANK YOU \u2013 PRAISE GOD!!!  Boholistic Mom says January 24, 2015 at 2:05 am While grape juice is slightly alkalinizing, the Vitamin C is probably the biggest contributor to helping avoid the stomach virus through grape juice. Lemon, orange, and grapefruit are MUCH more alkalinizing. Also, it\u2019s good to remember that Welch\u2019s is not organic so they will also have pesticides inside of the juice. I\u2019d find an organic 100% juice grape juice to try this method of prevention. Hope this helps a few more people know a little bit more about alkaline/acid foods.  Marsha says February 2, 2015 at 12:08 pm We are a family of 6; 4 kids in elementary school and an elementary school teacher in the house. We simply have a glass of grape juice with breakfast every morning. In the three years I have been using the grape juice prevention\u2026.we have had two instances where someone has ended up vomiting once and recovering quickly and definitely no multiple infections\u2026.I live by the grape juice theory and tell anyone and everyone about it.  Jenni says February 2, 2015 at 3:04 pm So I saw that you said 3 days later you still didn\u2019t have it. I have seen that it can take 7 days for it to appear\u2026. did you ever end up getting it or not? Grape juice isn\u2019t cheap and I don\u2019t want to stock up on it if after all you did get sick. Thanks  amber says February 2, 2015 at 8:37 pm I know it\u2019s been a while since the post and I haven\u2019t read all of the comments but if it\u2019s just making sure you\u2019re more alkaline then just drink some Braggs apple cider vinegar. That will help balance your pH.  Lisa says February 17, 2015 at 11:36 am Guess what mamas. Red wine does the same thing! My hubby had the stomach bug over Christmas\u2026.sorry but\u2026it was comin out both ends for a week. The kids both got sick just the once and were fine. I was determined NOT to get it\u2026so I did the same kinda research. Grape juice and red wine both work. As soon as I found this out\u2026I ran out and got my fave bottle of red\u2026am not ashamed to say I drank it all one night just to make sure of course (I was NOT letting myself get sick like that over Christmas)\u2026and I was the only one in the house that managed to escape it! I told a few friends\u2026.they had a similar situation\u2026and also missed out on hugging the toilet for a week. So\u2026save the grape juice for the kids, and grab a bottle of red. You\u2019ll have a much better time fighting off the flu \ud83d\ude09  Hilary says February 22, 2015 at 9:51 pm Does it have to be Welch\u2019s or will any 100% grape juice work?  Natalie says March 1, 2015 at 8:44 pm Welch\u2019s grape juice is all I would drink as a child. It now seems perhaps that is why I have not puked in 30 years, and only had the stomach flu once as a child\u2026  granny says March 12, 2015 at 5:40 pm Gentle reminder: It is not, \u201cMe and the kids,\u201d but \u201cThe kids and I.\u201d  anonymous says March 13, 2015 at 7:15 am Will juicy juice brand work? It says 100% juice no added sugar. Grape flavored juice blend from concentrate with other natural flavors and added ingredients. Has 120% vitamin C. My son\u2019s preschool class has the virus going around and 1st kid was sent home yesterday sick, don\u2019t want him or any of us to get sick, I have a vomit phobia.  Sarah says March 19, 2015 at 4:02 pm I always buy Welch\u2019s 100% purple grape juice. Any purple grape juice that is 100% grape juice will work. The juice you have sounds like a blend of juices instead of 100% grape juice. I wouldn\u2019t trust that to work.  Kenny says March 14, 2015 at 11:20 pm I have done this trick a lot when my wife and kid get sick I\u2019m always the one who doesn\u2019t catch it I normally drink 4-5 big glasses a day when I know their sick  Sarah says March 19, 2015 at 3:14 pm Thanks for sharing your experience with us!  Farmer says December 23, 2015 at 10:35 am If you\u2019ve already had the virus, will drinking grape juice keep you from being contagious?  Sarah Must Have Mom says December 23, 2015 at 11:48 pm No it shouldn\u2019t. It is a great way to avoid getting it but once you do have it, you need to follow normal protocol to prevent spreading it.  Deb says December 22, 2015 at 9:53 am Does wine work too What about white grape juice ???? Or sugar free.  Sarah Must Have Mom says December 22, 2015 at 8:34 pm It has to be 100% purple grape juice, so white grape wouldn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t\u2019 think the wine would work but you may be too drunk to care that you are sick. \ud83d\ude09  Kathryn says December 26, 2015 at 11:33 am Hello. I found this after learning we were exposed to stomach flu yesterday and wondering what might help boost our immune systems. Two questions, please: 1) Does it matter whether we use red or white grape juice? 2) Could you please provide links to the scientific research you found? I\u2019ve Googled, but nothing scientific turning up yet. Thanks so much. Crossing my fingers this works for us too!  JScot says December 29, 2015 at 9:44 am I ususally don\u2019t get the stomach stuff that goes around and comes home with my kids, so I\u2019m not convinced of these remedies, but my husband swears by taking Alka seltzer whenever he feels a twing of nausea or knows he\u2019s been exposed to food poisoning and so I tried it once when I felt something coming on and it stopped. So there may be something to the alkalizing effect. You cannot change your entire body\u2019s PH without killing yourself, by the way, but you can alter the PH of your stomach digestive contents. Worth a try!  Jen says February 2, 2016 at 10:51 pm Red Wine works the same. Seriously.  Ashli says October 29, 2016 at 10:21 pm This works so well. My sister saw this website and told me about it. The kids are around so much stuff schools we have been puke free for two years. \ud83d\ude42 Definitely a good probiotic (we use Bio-K) helps as well.  Sarah Must Have Mom says October 31, 2016 at 3:51 pm Yay for being puke free. It is such an easy thing that really works.  Sam says December 2, 2016 at 5:00 pm There is literally no such thing as a \u201cstomach flu\u201d. Influenza is a viral respiratory infection. The grape juice likely did nothing more than hydrate you and your family. The people who got sick were exposed and the ones who didn\u2019t weren\u2019t. I would also encourage you to seek out professional medical advice when your family gets sick rather than self diagnosing, which, in rare cases, can go horribly wrong.  Amanda Wells says December 12, 2016 at 6:50 pm I also have had success with this trick thanks to this blog post! I have seven children and several weeks ago my 5 year old became sick \u2013 lethargic, wouldn\u2019t eat, complaining of belly ache and finally vomited twice over the course of the day. I had my husband pick up 4 half \u2013 gallons on his way home from work that day and I dispensed it faithfully to the rest of my children 3 times a day for the next week and a half (we ended up buying 6 more jugs) . No one got sick, even the 2 year old who I caught drinking from his glass only a couple of hours after an episode of throwing up. I am so thankful for this knowledge as we usually have the stomach bug at least once every winter with so many small children in the house (my oldest is 10). It was hard for me to believe that it would work especially since we already supplement with pretty high doses of vitamin C and with the juice being pasteurized, I couldn\u2019t see how it would work but it did for us!  Sarah Must Have Mom says December 13, 2016 at 3:56 pm It is an amazing trick that really does work.  Katie Burgoyne says December 18, 2016 at 8:55 am Do you drink it everyday no matter what? Or just if you were exposed?  Sarah Must Have Mom says December 20, 2016 at 8:02 pm Every day, no matter what. It can help shorten downtime if exposed but can help prevent when you haven\u2019t been exposed.  Laura says December 30, 2016 at 7:20 am Does it have to be the purple 1 or does white grape work as well?  Sarah Must Have Mom says December 30, 2016 at 9:36 pm Laura, the purple works best. You want the 100% purple grape juice. The white grape just does not work as well.  Sarah Schultz says January 1, 2017 at 7:01 am Except there\u2019s so such thing as the \u201cstomach flu\u201d! It\u2019s gastroenteritis. By calling it a \u201cflu\u201d it perpetuates the myth that the influenza vaccine is ineffective. The real flu and gastro are two totally different illnesses.  Denise says January 3, 2017 at 7:28 pm This grape juice nonsense running rampant on the mommy sites has been debunked by actual scientists. It\u2019s like saying that you jumped up and down 3 times at 9 o\u2019clock in the morning and did not get a flat tire that day. So everybody should jump up and down 3 times at 9 o\u2019clock in the morning and they won\u2019t get flat tires. Whether or not you catch a stomach virus and someone is just luck. But attempting to tie it to something as scientifically unsubstantiated as drinking grape juice is so silly. You can put this theory in with the essential oils basket of nonsense and the rubbing Vicks Vapor Rub on your kids feet myth.  Jared says January 8, 2017 at 5:00 pm http://www.snopes.com/grape-juice-prevent-stomach-flu/  Danielle S says January 10, 2017 at 5:23 pm It\u2019s actually a pretty bad strain of stomach flu that is going around right now. Out of our household of seven, I was the only one who did not get it. Once my husband got it, I slept out in the living room away from him. I think that was the trick. I also did not touch anything with vomit on it with my bare hands. I did feel queasy for over a week, but no other problems.  Daley says January 11, 2017 at 2:56 pm Where is your \u2018little research\u2019 and the \u2018science behind it\u2019. Please provide the studies. Because how you describe pH and alkaline is NOT how the chemical processes work. There are no control group trials to prove this. This is bad woo \u2018science\u2019. But I\u2019m glad it works for you. And you\u2019re good with doing it to your kids, so that\u2019s what you want. There are great placebo trials out there. I expect this anecdotal experience of yours might fall into that category. I do love the taste of grape juice.  Rachel says January 12, 2017 at 2:32 pm Add some elderberry juice into your grape juice remedy. Elderberry has been used by Native Americans forever to help prevent and treat the stomach bug. It works wonders.  Vickie Couturier says February 23, 2017 at 12:48 pm wow,,very interesting post and responses,,we have always drank grape juice sick or not,,never harmed us at all  Jess says February 28, 2017 at 1:47 pm Omg I just did this. My 4 boys got sick. I was just fatigued. It\u2019s unbelievable. I drink 1 large glass w/5 drops of gse.  Donna B says March 9, 2017 at 10:00 pm This is so good to know. I appreciate you sharing this  heather b says March 20, 2017 at 9:37 am Definitely giving this a try next time we are sick!!  Rachel Kemper says March 22, 2017 at 1:16 pm How much grape juice do you drink just on a daily basis (not when you\u2019ve been exposed)?  Sarah says September 28, 2017 at 2:15 pm Just 1 cup  Marilyn Legault says April 20, 2017 at 7:37 am I\u2019ve heard good things about Welch\u2019s grape juice. Find it pricey though.  Sarah says September 28, 2017 at 2:13 pm You can certainly buy a store brand so long as it is 100% purple grape juice \ud83d\ude42  Dana Rodriguez says June 16, 2017 at 3:53 pm This is really initeresting! I love grape juice so now I have a reason to love it even more! Thanks for the tip!  Terri S. says September 20, 2017 at 12:56 pm Sarah, I\u2019m glad I read this post. I\u2019ve always enjoyed drinking Welch\u2019s 100% grape juice both for the taste as well as the benefits of Vitamin C and anti-oxidants. With cold and flu season approaching, I\u2019m planning on drinking it 3xs daily to avoid stomach flu.  Sarah says September 28, 2017 at 2:13 pm That\u2019s great to hear! Once a day is fine, but up it to 3X a day if exposed \ud83d\ude42  Vicky says September 25, 2017 at 10:38 pm Would other brands besides Welch\u2019s be OK and can you drink a mix\u2026CranGrape??  Sarah says September 28, 2017 at 2:12 pm As long as it is 100% purple grape juice with nothing else added. The CranGrape does not work the same way.  Shawn says September 28, 2017 at 2:00 pm Amazing article! Would these Citricidal products work just as well? https://www.amazon.com/Nutribiotic-Inc-Grapefruit-Extract-Tablets/dp/B0058AC4JW/ref=sr_1_2_s_it?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1506625035&sr=1-2&keywords=Citricidal https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dhpc&field-keywords=Citricidal+grapefruit  Sarah says September 28, 2017 at 2:12 pm While I have not personally tried those two products, they do appear to be similar so they should work the same.  Mr. MIX says November 29, 2017 at 11:15 am Ok, so I see a lot of comments on here questioning or frowning upon what is being stated here. SO HERE IS MY PERSONAL TESTIMONY NOVEMBER . DETAILS: I live in California and we went on a family trip up to Utah for Thanksgiving of this year 2017, my 4 month old daughter started throwing up the day after Thanksgiving and since she is being breastfed, we thought maybe it was something my wife ate. We stayed one more day to allow her fever to break and for her to feel a little better and we headed back down. The day we got back, my son said his stomach felt weird, he is 7 years old, and then as I was walking him to the restroom, he threw up everything he ate in the past week it seemed like. We will work on his aiming because he also missed the trash can next to his bed and threw up all over the floor multiple times. After cleaning it up with the rainbow, he made it in the trash can the last time. The next day, my wife tells me her stomach is feeling a bit queasy. I wasted no time, got an even bigger trash can, put it next to the bed went and got some saltine crackers and a cup of Canada Dry Ginger Ale I had bought for my son the previous day. Sure enough, about an hour later she\u2019s doing just the same as my daughter and my son did.  END RESULT ? The reason I give so much detail is to end it by saying, I was the only one cleaning up all of the throw up and dealing with three people who had the flu. I knew I was next, however, my wife text me the link to this website and said, \u201cgo buy grape juice immediately!\u201d  Although it says drink 3 cups a day, I was obviously a bit paranoid of catching the bug and ended up drinking all 64oz that day! So I have now been exposed for 5 days to the flu and I feel perfectly fine with absolutely no symptoms of a queasy stomach. All that I told my wife, was that I believed it simply reverse the flow from coming out the top to going out the bottom LOL and I\u2019m sure everyone agrees we would all rather have the flow going down\u2026. instead of UP!!! LOL  Alena says December 5, 2017 at 3:26 am Would dark wine work about the same way as grape juice?  Stephanie says December 29, 2017 at 1:24 pm If you don\u2019t want to try it then don\u2019t. It\u2019s that simple. If you\u2019re going to be negative, stay off someone\u2019s page. If you tried it and it didn\u2019t work then don\u2019t do it lol. I\u2019m gonna try it for the simple fact that I like grape juice and if I benefit from it by not getting Norovirus then yay me. Lona says January 13, 2018 at 1:54 pm We have also been doing this with great success so far! I did see where Welches makes a 100%, no added sugar, but it says \u201clight\u201d. With 2/3 less sugar. Will that still work?  Sarah says February 12, 2018 at 2:03 pm I use the 100% no added sugar. Should just say 100% grape juice on the ingredients.  Elle J says January 21, 2018 at 1:19 am Used this and it worked! I drank Kedem 100% grape juice and my other child and husband drank welches. Thanks for this post!!  Sarah says February 12, 2018 at 1:55 pm Glad to hear it worked for you Elle!  Jen says January 22, 2018 at 9:41 pm This absolutely does not work. I tried it with 3 of my kids and even mixed apple cider vinegar in it All 3 including my toddler got the stomach flu. My 5 year old is puking right now. Don\u2019t waste your money!  Sarah says February 12, 2018 at 1:53 pm I\u2019m sorry to hear it didn\u2019t work for you Jen. We actually hadn\u2019t been drinking it because we got lazy and my son threw up at school and came home sick. The rest of us immediately began drinking grape juice and none of us got sick. This has been the case every time we\u2019ve needed to prevent it and it\u2019s worked every time.  Sakura says July 3, 2018 at 8:48 pm A good way to avoid not getting it is to not have children. Those pests love to bring it home from school.  Miriam Willard says July 28, 2018 at 8:44 pm I was diagnosed with hepatitis B six years ago when I became pregnant with my first child. My husband got tested for the virus as well but the results turned out negative. I had no idea how or where I contracted that virus. I had no signs or symptoms before the test. Then last year the severe muscle cramps started. I had them from scalp to toes, I was so tired and nauseous and in constant pain. I was just sick and tired of feeling sick and tired!! nothing was really working to help my condition.I went off the Sebivo (with the doctor\u2019s knowledge) and started on hepatitis B herbal formula i ordered from Natural Herbal Gardens, my symptoms totally declined over a 7 weeks use of the hepatitis B virus natural herbal formula the disease is totally reversed!!  Sarah says July 30, 2018 at 1:57 pm Wow, what a great testimonial! I have to agree that natural remedies are often far superior to western medicine. I\u2019m glad to hear that you had success with a natural remedy.  Jennifer says October 28, 2018 at 9:03 am My son doesn\u2019t like juice at all. Could watering it down still work? Thanks.  Sarah says October 28, 2018 at 12:26 pm I haven\u2019t tried watering it down but if he was still drinking the same amount then I would think it would work.",

Major health authorities including the CDC and NHS do not recommend grape juice for norovirus prevention, and fact-checking sites such as Snopes have debunked this claim.\n- The proposed mechanism (altering intestinal pH to inhibit viral replication) is biologically implausible. Norovirus is highly resistant to environmental changes and stomach/intestine pH cannot be altered effectively with dietary grape juice alone.\n- The only proven methods to prevent norovirus spread are handwashing with soap and disinfecting contaminated surfaces.\n\nHowever, the \"partially\" qualifier is likely due to correct points made in the article:\n- \"Stomach flu\" is not true influenza; rather, most cases are caused by norovirus or other gastrointestinal viruses.\n- Anecdotes of families avoiding illness may be true for those individuals, but do not prove causality.\n\nIn summary: anecdotal reports exist, but there is no credible scientific evidence that grape juice prevents stomach virus infection. Thus, \"partially false\" is justified."

        "text": "Dental caries, commonly known as tooth decay, is the single most common chronic childhood disease. In fact, it is an infectious disease. Mothers with cavities can transmit caries-producing oral bacteria to their babies when they clean pacifiers by sticking them in their own mouths or by sharing spoons. According to Liliana Rozo, D.D.S., assistant profesor, University of Louisville School of Dentistry, tooth decay can have a detrimental effect on a child's quality of life, performance in school and success in life. The disease can cause pain, inability to chew food well, embarrassment about discolored or damaged teeth, and distraction from play and learning. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) encourages parents to find a dental home for their baby as soon as the child's first tooth erupts. Regular visits to a pediatric dentist will help parents become familiar with their child's dental and oral health milestones. They'll inform parents about teething, proper oral hygiene habits, normal tooth development, and trauma prevention. Nutritional counseling also will be a part of the discussion. Often, Rozo said, parents do not make the connection between oral health and overall health, but they are related. The mouth is an open door for many microbial infections to enter the bloodstream. Poor oral health may be a risk factor for systemic disease. Oral health manifestations, such as bleeding or dry mouth can indicate the presence of a systemic disease or exacerbate the effects of an existing disease such as diabetes and heart disease. So parents, too, should make their own oral health care a priority in order to help their children stay healthy, said Rozo, an AAPD board certified pediatric dentist.

The first sentence, according to Liliana Rozo, D.D.S., assistant professor at the University of Louisville School of Dentistry, states that tooth decay can have a detrimental effect on a child's quality of life, performance in school, and success in life. This is partially true. While tooth decay can indeed have negative impacts on oral health and overall well-being, it is not directly related to the contagiousness of cavities.  The second sentence claims that cavities are contagious, which is partially false. Cavities are not directly contagious, meaning they cannot be spread from person to person through casual contact. However, oral bacteria can be transmitted through various means such as poor oral hygiene, sharing food and drinks, or contaminated surfaces.  The third sentence states that poor oral health may be a risk factor for systemic disease. This is partially true. Research has shown that poor oral health has been linked to various systemic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory infections.

Yes ANTI-PERSPIRANT. Most of the products out there are an anti-perspirant/deodorant combination so go home and check your labels.\r\n\r\nDeodorant is fine, anti-perspirant is not. Here\u2019s why:\r\n\r\nThe human body has a few areas that it uses to purge toxins; behind the knees, behind the ears, groin area, and armpits. The toxins are purged in the form of perspiration.\r\n\r\nAnti-perspirant, as the name clearly indicates, prevents you from perspiring, thereby inhibiting the body from purging toxins from below the armpits. These toxins do not just magically disappear. Instead, the body deposits them in the lymph nodes below the arms since it cannot sweat them out. This causes a high concentration of toxins and leads to cell mutations: a.k.a. CANCER. Nearly all breast cancer tumors occur in the upper outside quadrant of the breast area. This is precisely where the lymph nodes are located.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, men are less likely (but not completely exempt) to develop breast cancer prompted by anti-perspirant usage because most of the anti-perspirant product is caught in their hair and is not directly applied to the skin. Women who apply anti-perspirant right after shaving increase the risk further because shaving causes almost imperceptible nicks in the skin which give the chemicals entrance into the body from the armpit area.\r\n\r\nPLEASE pass this along to anyone you care about. Breast Cancer is becoming frighteningly common. This awareness may save lives. If you are skeptical about these findings, I urge you to do some research for yourself. You will arrive at the same conclusions, I assure you.",

Major health organizations, such as the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute, have explicitly debunked this claim. Antiperspirants work by temporarily blocking sweat glands with aluminum-based compounds, but studies have not demonstrated that this leads to toxin build-up or increases cancer risk.\n\nMoreover, the body does not rely solely on sweating through the armpits to remove toxins\u2014most toxins are broken down by the liver and excreted via the kidneys. The claim that toxins are trapped in lymph nodes and cause cancer is biologically inaccurate. Additionally, research has not established any link between the location of breast tumors and antiperspirant use or shaving habits.\n\nEpidemiological studies have found no conclusive evidence connecting antiperspirant or deodorant use with an increased risk of breast cancer, regardless of gender or shaving practices. Therefore, this widely-circulated warning is not based on scientific fact, and the \"False\" rating is appropriate."

While bromelain does have anti-inflammatory properties, its effectiveness in treating various health conditions is still a topic of ongoing research and debate. 4.

Chemotherapy is a widely accepted and effective treatment for cancer, and numerous studies have shown its benefits in increasing survival rates and improving quality of life for patients. The statistics cited in the article are likely based on outdated or incorrect information, as the actual statistics are much higher. The claim that doctors prescribe chemotherapy only for financial gain is also entirely unfounded and lacks any scientific basis. Overall, this article appears to be a work of fiction designed to spread misinformation about cancer treatment.",

It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of coffee people drink \u2014 that includes decaf and instant coffee. And it also doesn\u2019t matter what version of the \u201ccoffee gene\u201d people have. Coffee-drinkers fared better than people who did not drink coffee.\r\n\r\nThe team at the National Cancer Institute used data from people taking part in a large genetic study in Britain called the U.K. Biobank. More than half a million people volunteered to give blood and answer detailed health and lifestyle questions for ongoing research into genes and health.\r\n\r\nThe team looked to see who drank coffee, how much and what kind of coffee, and looked for differences in several genes involved in metabolizing caffeine.\r\n\r\nThen they looked at death rates over 10 years of the study.\r\n\r\nPeople who drank coffee, no matter how much or what kind they drank, were less likely to die over that 10-year period than non-coffee drinkers, they reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association\u2019s JAMA Internal Medicine.\r\n\r\nEven people who said they drank more than eight cups a day were less likely to die, on average, than non-drinkers, the team, led by NCI\u2019s Erikka Lotfield, reported.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers were mostly British and have different coffee-drinking habits than much of the rest of the world. For one thing, they were more likely to drink instant coffee.\r\n\r\nAnd some of their habits and characteristics might make these British coffee-drinkers look unhealthier to start with. On the other hand, the U.K. Biobank volunteers are not representative of the British public and might, in fact, be healthier than average because volunteers for medical studies often are.\r\n\r\n\u201cCoffee drinkers, compared with non\u2013coffee drinkers, were more likely to be male, white, former smokers, and drink alcohol,\u201d Lotfield\u2019s team wrote.\r\n\r\n\u201cParticipants drinking four or more cups per day, compared with those drinking less coffee and nondrinkers, were more likely to drink instant coffee and be current smokers, whereas participants drinking one to three cups per day were older, more likely to have a university degree, and more likely to report \u2018excellent\u2019 health.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the 10 years of follow-up, more than 14,000 people died. But non-coffee drinkers were more likely to have died than coffee-drinkers.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere has been concern about the health effects of heavy coffee drinking, particularly in participants with common genetic polymorphisms (differences) that affect caffeine metabolism,\u201d the researchers wrote.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor example, prior studies have suggested that variants in CYP1A2, (a gene) encoding the enzyme responsible for more than 95 percent of caffeine metabolism, may alter associations of coffee drinking with cardiovascular-related outcomes, with slower caffeine metabolizers having higher risk of developing hypertension (high blood pressure) or having a myocardial infarction (heart attack) relative to their non-drinking counterparts, whereas faster caffeine metabolizers who drink coffee are at no or lower risk of these outcomes.\u201d\r\n\r\nTheir analysis showed no extra risk for any genetic variant, however.\r\n\r\nThere are several possible explanations for the health benefits of coffee.\r\n\r\nIt is the No. 1 source in the American diet of antioxidants \u2014 chemical compounds that fight the damage to DNA caused by day-to-day living.\r\n\r\nIt might reduce inflammation in the body, improve how insulin gets used, it might help liver function and it might benefit the linings of the blood vessels.\r\n\r\nThere is some evidence that coffee can help people recover from colon cancer, lower diabetes risk and reduce the inflammation associated with diabetes and heart disease.\r\n\r\nIt may also protect against diabetes, Parkinson's disease and liver cancer.\r\n\r\nWhile caffeine in large amounts can kill, it takes huge amounts of coffee to deliver a lethal dose - more than 20 cups at once.\r\n\r\nThe research team plans to break down the Biobank data by coffee preparation type \u2014 pressed coffee, versus filtered coffee, for example, to see if that makes any difference to health. Some studies have suggested that unfiltered coffee, made in percolaters or French presses, might raise unhealthy cholesterol levels.\r\n\r\nAnd the researchers say there's no added benefit to drinking more coffee than one usually does. The reduction in death rates did not get better as people drank more cups of daily coffee.",

        "text": "Currently in the world there are an astounding 350 million people who are suffering from some form of depression. That\u2019s 5% of the world population. As this condition becomes a more popular diagnosis, there needs to be alternatives to the common antidepressant prescription. Antidepressants can work wonders and perform miracles, but they can still leak toxins into the body that can cause addiction, worse health problems, and other mental health conditions. Depression is often caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain. Depression medications can cure these imbalances but usually leave some side effects including nausea, weight gain, insomnia, dry mouth, and blurred vision. For some people the side effects are minimal and almost absent, but for others the side effects can be as horrible as the depression. Many of those people are searching for a new type of treatment, one that can cure them without doing a different kind of harm. \r\n\r\nA New Alternative To Antidepressants.\r\n\r\nA new option has recently debuted in the medical world. A natural medication that can help treat depression as well, if not better than previous depression medications.This new miracle is magnesium. Magnesium is a mineral that the body naturally craves and recent studies have shown that 248 mg of magnesium per day can lead to an astounding reversal of depression symptoms.\r\n\r\nThanks to a rise in pharmaceutical prices, medication is often pricey and it can be tough to afford necessary medications. Depression medication can cost anywhere from $30.00-$200.00 per month. Over the course of a year this amount can build up to quite an expense. Unfortunately many people can not afford these rises and therefore can no longer afford their medications. One of the greatest things about the recent discovery of magnesium and its medicinal properties is that people can take magnesium for just pennies a day. Magnesium is an effective approach to treating depression and eliminating side effects. It is safer and cheaper than other prescription therapies and drugs.\r\n\r\nHow to Get Magnesium.\r\n\r\nThere are many foods that naturally contain magnesium like spinach, Swiss chard, pumpkin seeds, dark chocolate, and almonds. Each of these example have at least 75 mg of magnesium per serving so eating 3 to 4 servings would account for your intake for the day. Or if it is easier for you can purchase a supplement pill to take every day instead.\r\n\r\nTaking your daily dose of magnesium can really help improve your mental health as well as your physical health. Not only is magnesium great for helping with depression, but magnesium has a whole list of other wonderful benefits. Magnesium is great for brain health, kidney health, and cardiovascular health. Turning to natural remedies could save you a lot of a money in a year and it will help your body to heal without all the harsh chemicals and side effects. Natural is the way to go, it\u2019s great for your body and great for your pocket. If you are curious, give it a try, stop wondering and make the switch. Your body will thank you later.",

The article correctly reports on the findings of this study, showing how a daily intake of 248 mg of magnesium resulted in improvement of depression symptoms. It is also true that antidepressants come with some problematic side effects. That said, it is hard to say from the study whether magnesium works better than antidepressants, or that it can replace antidepressants (as suggested in the headline, which misinterprets the study). The patients in the study were all on different therapies (some on antidepressants, some on other therapies, while others had no treatment at all). A study with a more uniform population and a placebo group would be needed to make this comparison. It would have been good if the article provided more links to other studies supporting its claims, such as magnesium\u2019s effect on physical health. The article does over-sell magnesium\u2019s health benefits somewhat \u2013 there are downsides to excess magnesium intake that it should warn people about, such as diarrhea and cramping, especially since it encourages the taking of magnesium supplements.",

No major medical guidelines recommend magnesium as a standalone first-line treatment for depression.\n\nFurthermore, suggesting that magnesium is free of side effects and suitable for all individuals is misleading. Excess intake can be harmful, and not everyone with depression is magnesium-deficient.\n\nIn summary, the partial truth lies in real statistics and some benefits of magnesium, but the claims about magnesium as a miracle cure are unsupported, making the assessment \"partially false.\""

        "text": "The infamous pesticide DDT has been further implicated as a possible trigger for the development of autism spectrum disorder by an international group of epidemiologists and psychiatrists studying children who were exposed in utero.\r\n\r\nTheir findings, now published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, present the first evidence of a link between the banned chlorine-based chemical and the neurological condition that was drawn from cases where the mother was confirmed to have DDT in her body \u2013 past research has relied on estimated exposures calculated by each woman\u2019s residential proximity to DDT-polluted areas.\r\n\r\n\u201cDDT is still persisting in the environment and is detectable in almost everyone,\u201d lead author Dr Alan Brown told IFLScience. \u201cI would not say women should be concerned but it is important to be informed that at least this one chemical exposure is related to increased risk.\u201d\r\n\r\nDDT was first synthesized by chemists in 1874, but it wasn\u2019t widely used until its insecticidal properties were discovered in 1939. For the next several decades, the compound was freely and generously sprayed on food crops worldwide and directly into public spaces and people\u2019s homes.\r\n\r\nBut based on mounting evidence that the pesticide was harmful to both animals and humans, DDT was banned in the US in 1972 and in the European Union in 1986. In the time since, additional studies have confirmed that DDT accumulates and lingers in ecosystems, and that when ingested or inhaled, it can lead to reproductive issues and cancer.\r\n\r\nHoping to substantiate past work, Dr Brown\u2019s group drew data from a large, nationwide Finnish study that took blood serum samples from women during more than 1 million pregnancies that occurred between 1987 and 2005. Subjects of the current investigation included 778 of the resulting non-twin children who had been diagnosed with autism at any time point up to 2007, as well as 778 control children who were each matched, one-to-one, to each subject with autism in regards to date of birth, place of birth, and place of residence.\r\n\r\nThe level of DDT in the mother\u2019s system was quantified by a laboratory test for DDE, the chemical that DDT is metabolized into.\r\n\r\nExamining this data revealed that the likelihood of autism was 32 percent higher in children whose mothers harbored DDE levels in the 75th percentile (of the range of concentrations in all subject\u2019s mothers), after statistical adjustment for the influence of maternal age, family history of psychiatric disorders, number of siblings, and others. Furthermore, the odds of autism with intellectual disability were a staggering 121 percent higher if the mother had DDE levels above this threshold.\r\n\r\nThe study also looked at the risks associated with a class of industrial chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that were banned in 1979 in the US and in 1985 in Europe, but no association with autism was found. Confusingly, a similarly designed 2016 study did find a link to PCBs and failed to identify one with DDT.\r\n\r\nOf course, DDT is not the only environmental toxin suspected to drive epigenetic changes during fetal development. Dr Brown hopes his group\u2019s results will help clarify which chemicals to study further based on the developmental pathways they alter. Both DDT and PCBs affect the actions of male sex hormones in utero \u2013 which are being increasingly implicated in autism \u2013 yet do so differently. DDT is known to inhibit the production and function of receptors for these hormones, whereas PCBs increase the number of receptors.",

        "text": "A high-carb diet, and the attendant high blood sugar, are associated with cognitive decline.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, Alzheimer\u2019s disease has occasionally been referred to as \u201ctype 3\u201d diabetes, though that moniker doesn\u2019t make much sense. After all, though they share a problem with insulin, type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, and type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease caused by diet. Instead of another type of diabetes, it\u2019s increasingly looking like Alzheimer\u2019s is another potential side effect of a sugary, Western-style diet.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the path from sugar to Alzheimer\u2019s leads through type 2 diabetes, but as a new study and others show, that\u2019s not always the case.\r\n\r\nA longitudinal study, published Thursday in the journal Diabetologia, followed 5,189 people over 10 years and found that people with high blood sugar had a faster rate of cognitive decline than those with normal blood sugar\u2014whether or not their blood-sugar level technically made them diabetic. In other words, the higher the blood sugar, the faster the cognitive decline.\r\n\r\n\u201cDementia is one of the most prevalent psychiatric conditions strongly associated with poor quality of later life,\u201d said the lead author, Wuxiang Xie at Imperial College London, via email. \u201cCurrently, dementia is not curable, which makes it very important to study risk factors.\u201d\r\n\r\nMelissa Schilling, a professor at New York University, performed her own review of studies connecting diabetes to Alzheimer\u2019s in 2016. She sought to reconcile two confusing trends. People who have type 2 diabetes are about twice as likely to get Alzheimer\u2019s, and people who have diabetes and are treated with insulin are also more likely to get Alzheimer\u2019s, suggesting elevated insulin plays a role in Alzheimer\u2019s. In fact, many studies have found that elevated insulin, or \u201chyperinsulinemia,\u201d significantly increases your risk of Alzheimer\u2019s. On the other hand, people with type 1 diabetes, who don\u2019t make insulin at all, are also thought to have a higher risk of Alzheimer\u2019s. How could these both be true?\r\n\r\nSchilling posits this happens because of the insulin-degrading enzyme, a product of insulin that breaks down both insulin and amyloid proteins in the brain\u2014the same proteins that clump up and lead to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. People who don\u2019t have enough insulin, like those whose bodies\u2019 ability to produce insulin has been tapped out by diabetes, aren\u2019t going to make enough of this enzyme to break up those brain clumps. Meanwhile, in people who use insulin to treat their diabetes and end up with a surplus of insulin, most of this enzyme gets used up breaking that insulin down, leaving not enough enzyme to address those amyloid brain clumps.\r\n\r\nAccording to Schilling, this can happen even in people who don\u2019t have diabetes yet\u2014who are in a state known as \u201cprediabetes.\u201d It simply means your blood sugar is higher than normal, and it\u2019s something that affects roughly 86 million Americans.\r\n\r\nSchilling is not primarily a medical researcher; she\u2019s just interested in the topic. But Rosebud Roberts, a professor of epidemiology and neurology at the Mayo Clinic, agreed with her interpretation.\r\n\r\nIn a 2012 study, Roberts broke nearly 1,000 people down into four groups based on how much of their diet came from carbohydrates. The group that ate the most carbs had an 80 percent higher chance of developing mild cognitive impairment\u2014a pit stop on the way to dementia\u2014than those who ate the smallest amount of carbs. People with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, can dress and feed themselves, but they have trouble with more complex tasks. Intervening in MCI can help prevent dementia.\r\n\r\nRebecca Gottesman, a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins, cautions that the findings on carbs aren\u2019t as well-established as those on diabetes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be sure at this stage, what an \u2018ideal\u2019 diet would look like,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a suggestion that a Mediterranean diet, for example, may be good for brain health.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut she says there are several theories out there to explain the connection between high blood sugar and dementia. Diabetes can also weaken the blood vessels, which increases the likelihood that you\u2019ll have ministrokes in the brain, causing various forms of dementia. A high intake of simple sugars can make cells, including those in the brain, insulin resistant, which could cause the brain cells to die. Meanwhile, eating too much in general can cause obesity. The extra fat in obese people releases cytokines, or inflammatory proteins that can also contribute to cognitive deterioration, Roberts said. In one study by Gottesman, obesity doubled a person\u2019s risk of having elevated amyloid proteins in their brains later in life.\r\n\r\nRoberts said that people with type 1 diabetes are mainly only at risk if their insulin is so poorly controlled that they have hypoglycemic episodes. But even people who don\u2019t have any kind of diabetes should watch their sugar intake, she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust because you don\u2019t have type 2 diabetes doesn\u2019t mean you can eat whatever carbs you want,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially if you\u2019re not active.\u201d What we eat, she added, is \u201ca big factor in maintaining control of our destiny.\u201d Roberts said this new study by Xie is interesting because it also shows an association between prediabetes and cognitive decline.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s an important point that often gets forgotten in discussions of Alzheimer\u2019s. It\u2019s such a horrible disease that it can be tempting to dismiss it as inevitable. And, of course, there are genetic and other, non-nutritional factors that contribute to its progression. But, as these and other researchers point out, decisions we make about food are one risk factor we can control. And it\u2019s starting to look like decisions we make while we\u2019re still relatively young can affect our future cognitive health.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlzheimer\u2019s is like a slow-burning fire that you don\u2019t see when it starts,\u201d Schilling said. It takes time for clumps to form and for cognition to begin to deteriorate. \u201cBy the time you see the signs, it\u2019s way too late to put out the fire.\u201d",

Proposed mechanisms include insulin resistance, inflammation, and vascular damage, all of which are promoted by chronically elevated blood sugar.\n\nAdditionally, prospective studies link higher dietary intake of simple carbohydrates with a greater risk of mild cognitive impairment and progression to dementia. While causation is not fully established, the overall direction of evidence supports the claim: high blood sugar, commonly induced by high carbohydrate diets, is associated with increased cognitive decline.

        "text": "[Collected on the Internet, 2000]\r\n\r\nEver wondered what\u2019s in a can of Redbull Energy drink? The small print lists a host of ingredients and among them is Glucuronolactone, an artificially manufactured stimulant developed in the early 60\u2019s by the American Government.\r\n\r\nGlucuronolactone was first used in the Vietnam conflict to boost morale amongst GI\u2019s who were suffering from stress and fatigue, but was banned after a few years following several deaths and hundreds of cases involving anything from severe migraines to brain tumours in personnel prescribed the stimulant.\r\n\r\nThat was in 1973 and Glucuronolactone is still banned for commercial consumption in America this day. The bad news is that the substance never found it\u2019s way to Europe in the early days and was therefore never banned by the EU community. An article in this months edition of the British Medical Journal has highlighted a growing number of cases reported by Doctors and Surgeons involving the very same side effects from the 70\u2019s.\r\n\r\nAll of the patients examined were regular drinkers of RedBull and it is believed that the safety of Glucuronolactone is currently under review in at least three major European countries.\r\n\r\nPlease pass this on to any RedBull drinkers you know, and next time you get a headache after drinking the stuff, you\u2019ll know why!\r\n \r\n\r\n[Collected on the Internet, 2012]\r\n\r\nFrance & Denmark have banned it \u2026\r\n\r\nRED BULL \u2013 slow death \u2026\r\n\r\nDo NOT drink this drink anymore!!\r\nPay attention; read it all\r\n\r\nAs a public health safety, please pass on this email to all the contacts\r\nin your address book especially those with teenage children?\r\n\r\nThis drink is SOLD in all the supermarkets IN OUR country and our\r\nchildren ARE CONSUMING IT ON A TRIAL BASIS, IT can be mortal.\r\n\r\nRED BULL was created to stimulate the brains in people who are subjected\r\nto great physical force and in stress coma and never to be consumed like\r\nan innocent drink or soda pop.\r\n\r\nRED BULL IS the energizer DRINK that is commercialized world-wide with\r\nits slogan:\u2019It increases endurance; awakens the concentration capacity\r\nand the speed of reaction, offers more energy and improves the mood. All\r\nthis can be found in a can of RED BULL , the power drink of the\r\nmillennium.\r\n\r\n\u2018RED BULL has managed to arrive at almost 100 countries worldwide. The\r\nRED BULL logo is targeted at young people and sportsmen, two attractive\r\nsegments that have been captivated by the stimulus that the drink\r\nprovides.\r\n\r\nIt was created by Dietrich Mateschitz, an industrialist of Austrian\r\norigin who discovered the drink by chance. It happened during a business\r\ntrip to Hong Kong , when he was working at a factory that manufactured\r\ntoothbrushes.\r\n\r\nThe liquid, based on a formula that contained caffeine and taurine,\r\ncaused a rage in that country. Imagine the grand success of this drink\r\nin Europe where the product still did not exist, besides it was a superb\r\nopportunity to become an entrepreneur.\r\nBUT THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS DRINK IS ANOTHER THING:\r\n\r\nFRANCE and DENMARK have just prohibited it. They call it the \u201cCocktail\r\nof Death\u201d,due to its vitamin components mixed with GLUCURONOLACTONE\u2019 , a\r\nhighly dangerous chemical, which was developed by the United States\r\nDepartment of Defense during the sixties to stimulate the moral of the\r\ntroops based in VIETNAM, which acted like a hallucinogenic drug that\r\ncalmed the stress of the war.\r\n\r\nBut their effects in the organism were so devastating, that it was\r\ndiscontinued, because of the high index of cases of migraines, cerebral\r\ntumors and diseases of the liver that was evident in the soldiers who\r\nconsumed it.Remember the Denzel Washington movie where ex-Vietnam\r\nsoldiers still suffered hallucinations long after the war ended? This\r\nmovie was based on fact.\r\n\r\nAnd in spite of it, in the can of RED BULL you can still find as one of\r\nits components: GLUCURONOLACTONE, categorized medically as a stimulant.\r\nBut what it does not say on the can of RED BULL is what the consequences\r\nof its consumption are, and that has forced us to place a series of\r\nWARNINGS:\r\n\r\n1. It is dangerous to take it if you do not engage in physical exercise\r\nafterwards, since its energizing function accelerates the heart rate and\r\ncan cause a sudden attack.\r\n\r\n2. You run the risk of undergoing a cerebral hemorrhage, because RED\r\nBULL contains components that dilute the blood so that the heart\r\nutilizes less energy to pump the blood, and thus be able to deliver\r\nphysical force with less effort being exerted.\r\n\r\n3. It is prohibited to mix RED BULL with alcohol, because the mixture\r\nturns the drink into a \u201cDeadly Bomb\u201d that attacks the liver directly,\r\ncausing the affected area never to regenerate anymore.\r\n\r\n4. One of the main components of RED BULL is the B12 vitamin, used in\r\nmedicine to recover patients who are in a coma; from here the\r\nhypertension and the state of excitement which is experienced after\r\ntaking it, as if you were in a drunken state.\r\n\r\n5. The regular consumption of RED BULL triggers off symptoms in the form\r\nof a series of irreversible nervous and neuronal diseases.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: It is a drink that should be prohibited in the entire world\r\nas when it is mixed with alcohol it creates a TIME BOMB for the human\r\nbody, mainly innocent adolescents and adults with little experience.",

No proof has yet emerged that this would pose a danger of any sort, but it is a large enough number in and of itself to evoke concern. Red Bull does contain glucuronolactone. But as we've seen, that ingredient is apparently innocuous. Criticisms of the beverage primarily have to do with the amount of caffeine (equivalent to that found in a typical cup of coffee) and sugar (about 5 teaspoons per 250 ml can) contained in the brew.",

Regulatory agencies, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the US FDA, have assessed these claims and found no scientific basis.

        "text": "Scientists Find Root That Kills 98% Of Cancer Cells In Only 48 Hours\r\n\r\nPosted by admin on Sep 26, 2016 in Cancer, Health | 0 comments\t\r\n\r\nDandelion has been used medicinally since ancient times for its various health benefits. However, the most powerful benefit to come out of this common weed is something that medical researchers are super excited to have \u201cdiscovered\u201d \u2013 which is its potential to cure cancer!\r\nThis potent root builds up blood and immune system- cures prostate, lung, and other cancers better than chemotherapy. According to Dr. Carolyn Hamm from the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre in Ontario, Canada, dandelion root extract was the only thing that helped with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This form of cancer typically affects older adults.\r\n\r\nJohn Di Carlo, who at the time was a 72-year old cancer patient at the hospital, was sent home to live out his final days after all efforts failed to treat his leukemia. He told CBC News that he was advised to drink dandelion root tea as a last ditch effort. Perhaps it should have been the first option offered in his treatment plan, as his cancer went into remission only four months later! His doctors attributed this to the dandelion tea that he drank.\r\n\r\nRecent studies have shown that dandelion root extract can work very quickly on cancer cells, as was evidenced in Di Carlo\u2019s case. Within 48 hours of coming into contact with the extract, cancerous cells begin to disintegrate. The body happily replaces these with healthy new cells.\r\n\r\nFurther studies have concluded that the extract also has anti-cancer benefits for other types of cancer, including breast, colon, prostate, liver, and lung cancer! Dandelion root tea may not taste as pleasant as other teas, but it\u2019s certainly more pleasant than living with the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation treatments.\r\n\r\nTraditional cancer therapies harm the immune system by killing all cells, even the healthy ones. Dandelion root has the opposite effect \u2013 it actually helps boost your immune system and only targets the unhealthy cells. It\u2019s definitely a win-win situation!\r\n\r\nDr. Hamm warns, however, that dandelion root extract can negatively impact the effects of chemotherapy. It\u2019s always best to consult with your doctor, and let them know any and all supplements or foods that you are consuming on a regular basis.\r\nEven if you don\u2019t have cancer, eating the greens or drinking dandelion tea can still give you great health! For example, the roots and stems of dandelion can help fight diabetes. It does this by stimulating the pancreas to produce insulin, which in turn stabilizes the spikes in blood sugar levels.\r\n\r\nIf you suffer from digestive issues or need to get rid of toxins, dandelion tea may be just what the herbal medicine doctor ordered! The liver aids the digestive system by producing bile, and it also filters the blood of chemicals and other impurities. According to Dr. Axe, the vitamins and minerals found in dandelions can help cleanse the liver and keep it in tip top shape. So by supporting your liver, you are actually creating better health!\r\n\r\nDandelions are also high in antioxidants and vitamin C, which is crucial to helping your body fight off infections, such as the bacteria that cause urinary tract infections. If you suffer from frequent bouts of UTI, drinking dandelion tea on a daily basis may prevent it from happening ever again.\r\n\r\nDandelion greens are bitter, but completely edible \u2013 as long as you get it from an area that hasn\u2019t been sprayed with chemicals. The greens are rich in fiber, which is great for intestinal health! High fiber diets have also been shown to reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, and irritable bowel syndrome.\r\n\r\nThe greens are also high in vitamin A \u2013 just one cup contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance. Vitamin A is critical for maintaining healthy vision, and it can also prevent premature aging of the skin.\r\n\r\nSince you probably aren\u2019t likely to eat an entire cup of bitter greens on its own, you can incorporate it into a morning smoothie. Just blend it up with your favorite fruit, which will offset the bitter taste.",

        "original_reasoning_text": "The given news item claims that dandelion root can kill 98% of cancer cells in 48 hours.

Furthermore, the article also mentions that \"Dr. Hamm warns, however, that dandelion root extract can negatively impact the effects of chemotherapy.\" This suggests that dandelion root extract may not be suitable for everyone, especially those undergoing chemotherapy.

Only limited early-phase human trials exist, and no regulatory authority recognizes dandelion as a cancer cure. The individual case cited in the article (John Di Carlo) is anecdotal, and does not constitute scientific proof.\n\nThe article mentions plausible health benefits of dandelion (vitamins, antioxidants, digestive aid), but its cancer cure claims are not supported by scientific consensus.

        "text": "Several years ago, I had a man seeking asparagus for a friend who had cancer. He gave me a photocopied copy of an article, entitled, \u2018Asparagus for cancer\u2019 printed in Cancer News Journal, December 1979.\r\n\r\nI will share it here, just as it was shared with me: \u2018I am a biochemist, and have specialized in the relation of diet to health for over 50 years. Several years ago, I learned of the discovery of Richard R. Vensal, D.D.S. that asparagus might cure cancer.\r\n\r\nSince then, I have worked with him on his project. We have accumulated a number of favourable case histories.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples:\r\n\r\nCase No. 1,\r\nA man with an almost hopeless case of Hodgkin\u2019s disease (cancer of the lymph glands) who was completely incapacitated. Within 1 year of starting the asparagus therapy, his doctors were unable to detect any signs of cancer, and he was back on a schedule of strenuous exercise.\r\n\r\nCase No. 2,\r\nA successful businessman 68 years old who suffered from cancer of the bladder for 16 years. After years of medical treatments, including radiation without improvement, he went on asparagus. Within 3 months, examinations revealed that his bladder tumor had disappeared and that his kidneys were normal.\r\n\r\nCase No. 3,\r\na man who had lung cancer. On March 5th 1971, he was put on the operating table where they found lung cancer so widely spread that it was inoperable. The surgeon sewed him up and declared his case hopeless. On April 5th he heard about the asparagus therapy and immediately started taking it. By August, x-ray pictures revealed that all signs of the cancer had disappeared. He is back at his regular business routine.\r\n\r\nCase No. 4,\r\nA woman who was troubled for a number of years with skin cancer. She finally developed different skin cancers which were diagnosed by asking specialist as advanced. Within 3 months after starting on asparagus, her skin specialist said that her skin looked fine and no more skin lesions. This woman reported that the asparagus therapy also cured her kidney disease, which started in 1949. She had over 10 operations for kidney stones, and was receiving government disability payments for an inoperable, terminal, kidney condition. She attributes the cure of this kidney trouble entirely to the asparagus.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised at this result, as \u2018The elements of Materia Medica\u2019, edited in 1854 by a Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, stated that asparagus was used as a popular remedy for kidney stones. He even referred to experiments, in 1739, on the power of asparagus in dissolving stones.\r\n\r\nWe would have other case histories but the medical establishment has interfered with our obtaining some of the records. I am therefore appealing to readers to spread this good news and help us to gather a large number of case histories that will overwhelm the medical skeptics about this unbelievably simple and natural remedy. For the treatment, asparagus should be cooked before using, and therefore canned asparagus is just as good as fresh.\r\n\r\nI have corresponded with the two leading canners of asparagus, Green Giant and Stokely, and I am satisfied that these brands contain no pesticides or preservatives.\r\n\r\nPROCEDURE:\r\n1) Place the cooked asparagus in a blender and liquefy to make a puree, and store in the refrigerator.\r\n\r\n2) Give the patient 4 full tablespoons twice daily, morning and evening.\r\n\r\nPatients usually show some improvement in from 2-4 weeks. It can be diluted with water and used as a cold or hot drink. This suggested dosage is based on present experience, but certainly larger amounts can do no harm and may be needed in some cases.\r\n\r\nAs a biochemist I am convinced of the old saying that \u2018what cures can prevent\u2019. Based on this theory, my wife and I have been using asparagus puree as a beverage with our meals.\r\n\r\nWe take 2 tablespoons diluted in water to suit our taste with breakfast and with dinner. I take mine hot and my wife prefers\r\nhers cold.\r\n\r\nFor years we have made it a practice to have blood surveys taken as part of our regular checkups.\r\n\r\nThe last blood survey, taken by a medical doctor who specializes in the nutritional approach to health, showed substantial improvements in all categories over the last one, and we can attribute these improvements to nothing but the asparagus drink\u2026\r\n\r\nAs a biochemist, I have made an extensive study of all aspects of cancer, and all of the proposed cures. As a result, I am convinced that asparagus fits in better with the latest theories about cancer. Asparagus contains a good supply of protein called histones, which are believed to be active in controlling cell growth. For that reason, I believe asparagus can be said to contain a substance that I call cell growth normalizer. That accounts for its action on cancer and in acting as a general body tonic. In any event, regardless of theory,asparagus used as we suggest, is a harmless substance.\r\n\r\nThe FDA cannot prevent you from using it and it may do you much good.. It has been reported by the US National Cancer Institute, that asparagus is the highest tested food containing glutathione, which is considered one of the body\u2019s most potent anticarcinogens and antioxidants.",
        "claim": "Asparagus has miraculous cancer-fighting properties.",
        "original_reasoning_text": "Reasoning: There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that asparagus can cure cancer. While asparagus does contain some beneficial compounds like glutathione, which is an antioxidant and anticarcinogen, there is no credible research to suggest that it has cancer-fighting properties.

The reported cases of cancer remission and kidney disease cure are likely exaggerated or fabricated.",

While glutathione plays a role in cell protection and some lab studies suggest it might help fight oxidative stress, there is no evidence that dietary glutathione from asparagus or any food prevents or cures cancer in humans.\n- **Harmlessness & Nutritional Value:** Asparagus is indeed a nutritious vegetable and generally safe to consume.\n- **Partly Accurate Citations:** References to historical uses (e.g., kidney stones, nutritional benefits) have some basis, but not for cancer.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is partially false: while asparagus is healthy and antioxidant-rich, the assertion of a cancer cure is unsubstantiated."

The news item appears to be based on a study that found that the tops of soda cans are more contaminated than public toilets. However, it is unclear if this study actually found that the contamination was caused by rat urine, as the news item claims. The language used is sensational and alarmist, stating that rat urine contains \"toxic and deathly substances\" and that the dried urine on a soda can is \"toxic and obviously lethal\". This type of language is not typical of a scientific study and suggests that the news item may be exaggerating or misrepresenting the findings of the study. Additionally, there is no evidence provided to support the claim that rat urine is capable of causing Leptospirosis.   It is worth noting that Leptospirosis is a serious bacterial infection caused by exposure to the urine of infected animals, such as rats. However, it is not typically spread through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, such as soda cans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state that Leptospirosis is typically spread through contact with the urine of infected animals, usually through breaks in the skin or through contact with contaminated water or food.

Having cleared that up, we can turn to the medical claims. In general, they overstate the implications of legitimate (though limited) laboratory investigations and animal studies. More accurately, it would valid to say that some specific chemicals identified in Brazilian propolis may have potential as a cancer therapy if the results of animal or cell-line studies are shown to hold relevance to humans. From a basic fact checking standpoint, the above chemicals are present in the forms of propolis listed above. And indeed, animal studies of artepillin-C from Brazilian propolis have demonstrated potential in fighting breast or prostate cancer. CAPE sourced from propolis has been shown to be effective at inhibiting the growth of breast cancer in cell line studies. Brazilian red propolis, in general, has been shown to combat colon cancer in studies as well. Whether or not these studies hold relevance to humans remains to be seen, but it is important to note that the above studies, for the most part, have tested isolated chemicals in regulated doses, and the chemical makeup of propolis varies considerably sample by sample.

No official pharmacopoeia lists it as a vitamin, and it does not possess any of the required characteristics of a vitamin. Amygdalin is a naturally occurring compound that can be found in a variety of foods, most notably bitter almonds and the pits of apricots and other fruits.

Overshadowing this unceasing onslaught quacktastic red flags are two hard truths: 1) there is effectively no evidence that laetrile, amygdalin, B17, etc., have any efficacy as a cancer treatment for humans and 2) there is plenty of evidence to suggest that amygdalin and related compounds are extremely toxic to humans, a problem compounded by the fact that several studies have shown that amygdalin supplements vary wildly in the accuracy of their concentrations and are completely unregulated.",

According to regulatory bodies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), PET plastics do not contain dioxins, nor do they release them when frozen or heated under normal conditions. Similarly, DEHA, mentioned in some versions of this rumor, is not used in PET bottle manufacture, and even when present elsewhere, has not been clearly linked to cancer in humans.\n\nHowever, the advice to avoid exposing plastic bottles to excessive heat (e.g., leaving them in a hot car) is based on general chemical safety principles, as this could theoretically lead to the leaching of some chemicals\u2014although not dioxins\u2014over time. Still, this is considered a minor risk and not sufficient to cause cancer as claimed.\n\nIn conclusion, while minor caution regarding heat is sensible, the alarming claims about dioxins, DEHA, and cancer are false, hence the \"partially false\" evaluation."

The misleading terminology is obscuring one very dark fact about dementia: Many times, it\u2019s being caused not by something scientists are still struggling to understand like Alzheimer\u2019s but rather by things that are masquerading as tools for good health; vaccines and prescription drugs.\r\nIn fact, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association that publicizes these statistics is subsidized by Big Pharma. It\u2019s simply good business sense that they want people to believe that every memory-loss patient falls under the Alzheimer\u2019s umbrella because then they can sell you drugs that purportedly address it. Their research has led them to an approach that pays dividends: promoting and destigmatizing what many think of as \u201cmental illnesses,\u201d making them seem unpreventable but manageable with drugs. Many people who work for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and similar organizations are well-meaning people who want to help and are often unaware of the connection to Big Pharma.\r\n\r\nYou have more control over \u201cdementia\u201d than you\u2019re being led to believe.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that dementia cases have been spiking during the same time that children and adults alike are being over-vaccinated (flu shot, anyone?) and the over-prescription of brain-altering drugs like antidepressants is prevalent.\r\nA help guide based on a Harvard University report admits as much. According to the report, \u201cmedications are common culprits in mental decline.\u201d As the body ages, the liver\u2019s efficiency when it comes to metabolizing drugs declines, and the kidneys do not eliminate them as quickly as they once did. This causes the drugs to accumulate in the body, which means those who take multiple medications are particularly susceptible to this effect.\r\nIncluded in the list of drugs published in the guide that cause dementia-like symptoms are antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, sedatives, corticosteroids, narcotics, antihistamines, cardiovascular drugs, and anticonvulsants. It\u2019s a very broad range of drugs, and many elderly people take medications from one or more of those categories. In fact, you might want to go check your medicine cabinet right now.\r\nA study published in JAMA Internal Medicine correlated the use of popular medications like Benadryl and other anticholinergic drugs with dementia onset. According to the researchers, patients who took these medications for three years or more had a 54 percent higher chance of going on to develop the disorder.\r\nVaccines are also responsible for causing symptoms mistaken for dementia. People in their 40s are increasingly being diagnosed with \u201cdementia,\u201d and experts believe that environmental factors must be responsible in these cases. Mercury-containing thimerosalwas used widely in childhood vaccines until 2001 and remains in some vaccines, including flu shots, to this day. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease found that exposure to mercury could produce many of the changes that are seen in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, including impaired cognitive function and memory as well as confusion.\r\nResearcher Richard Deth stated: \u201cMercury is clearly contributing to neurological problems, whose rate is increasing in parallel with rising levels of mercury. It seems that the two are tied together.\u201d\r\nAnother common ingredient found in vaccines, aluminum, has been linked to dementia as well.\r\nIt\u2019s a pretty smart way to keep the profit machine turning for Big Pharma: Convince people they need vaccines or drugs, and when those vaccines or drugs cause further side effects and illnesses, sell them even more drugs to counteract them. And the best part for them is that because mental decline is involved, it reduces the chances that people will wake up to what is really going on here.",
        "claim": "According to research, many cases of dementia are actually side effects of prescription drugs or vaccines.",
        "original_reasoning_text": "The article claims that many cases of dementia are actually caused by drugs and vaccines, instead of being legitimate Alzheimer\u2019s cases, and that this is actually a conspiracy by Big Pharma to sell more drugs and make more money off people.\r\n\r\nIt cites several legitimate information sources (such as research studies in reputable journals and a website linked to Harvard), but uses this information in a manner that draws erroneous conclusions meant to mislead the reader, such as the claim that the aluminium and mercury in vaccines cause cognitive decline. It is true that these compounds can be neurotoxic (like many other common chemicals), but not at the minuscule concentrations found in vaccines.\r\n\r\nThe study published in JAMA does indeed show that use of anticholinergic drugs are associated with dementia \u2013 a side effect that many other studies have found. However, no drug is free from side effects. Certainly, these findings show that people should be more aware of their medications, and communicate with their medical provider about any negative effects that they experience. But the unfounded fearmongering this article contains could cause people to suddenly stop taking their prescription medication without consulting their medical provider, which could be dangerous.",

The referenced JAMA study discusses anticholinergic drugs and an association with increased dementia risk, but does not prove causation. The article falsely conflates short-term medication side effects with actual dementia.\n\nAdditionally, allegations that the Alzheimer\u2019s Association is subsidized by \"Big Pharma\" to promote drug use are unsupported conspiracy theories, with no factual basis.\n\nIn summary, the claims in the news item grossly misrepresent existing evidence and propagate misinformation about vaccines, prescription drugs, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, warranting a \"False\" rating."

        "text": "Listen up, gen-Xers and millennials, and, well, everybody who has a brain. If you live a high-stress life, you could have memory loss and brain shrinkage before you turn 50, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.\r\n\"Higher levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, seem to predict brain function, brain size and performance on cognitive tests,\" said study author Dr. Sudha Seshadri, professor of neurology at UT Health San Antonio.\r\n\r\n\"We found memory loss and brain shrinkage in relatively young people long before any symptoms could be seen,\" Seshadri said. \"It's never too early to be mindful of reducing stress.\"\r\n\r\nToo much 'flight or fight'.\r\n\r\nCortisol is one of the body's key stress hormones, best known for its role in our \"flight or fight\" instincts. When we are stressed and on high alert, the adrenal glands produce more cortisol. The hormone then goes to work shutting down various bodily functions that might get in the way of survival.\r\nOnce the crisis has passed, cortisol levels should drop, and the body systems should return to normal. But if your alarm button stays pressed, the body can continue to malfunction, leading to anxiety, depression, heart disease, headaches, weight gain, trouble sleeping, and, of course, memory and concentration problems.\r\nThe brain is especially vulnerable, say experts, because of all of the nutrients it needs to function optimally.\r\n\"The brain is a very hungry organ,\" said Keith Fargo, who directs scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association. \"It requires an outsized amount of nutrients and oxygen to keep it healthy and functioning properly. So, when the body needs those resources to deal with stress, there's less to go around to the brain.\"\r\n\r\nHigh stress connected to memory loss.\r\n\r\nPrevious studies have found a relationship between cortisol and dementia risk, but the focus has been mostly on the elderly and the memory area of the brain, called the hippocampus.\r\n\r\nAmong the new study's strengths, said Seshadri, is that it looked at a group of men and women with an average age of 48 and did MRI brain scans of the entire brain, not just the hippocampus.\r\nResearchers chose more than 2,000 people with no signs of dementia and gave them various psychological exams to measure their thinking skills.\r\nAll were part of the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. It's been following the health of residents of Framingham, Massachusetts, and their offspring since 1948.\r\nAbout eight years after initial testing, the group was reevaluated. Blood serum cortisol was measured before breakfast. Then brain MRIs were done and the series of memory and cognitive tests repeated.\r\nAfter adjusting the data to consider age, sex, body mass and smoking, the study found people with the highest levels of cortisol had the most memory loss.\r\n\"I wasn't surprised by the changes in cognition,\" said Fargo who was not involved in the study. \"If you have higher cortisol you're probably stressed out and likely to have more difficulty on cognitive tasks.\"\r\n\r\nStress affects brain structure, too.\r\n\r\nWhat was surprising, said Fargo, was the study's findings of the effects of cortisol on brain structure.\r\n\r\nHigh levels of cortisol were associated with more damage to the parts of the brain that move information throughout the brain (corona radiata) and between the two hemispheres of the brain (corpus callosum).\r\nIn addition, the brains of people with higher cortisol levels had smaller cerebrums, the two hemispheres of the brain responsible for thought, emotions, speech and muscle functions, the study found.\r\nThe average total cerebral brain volume in people with high levels of cortisol was 88.5 of the total brain volume, compared to 88.7 in people with normal levels of cortisol.\r\n\"I was surprised you would be able to see such a large change in brain structure with high cortisol levels compared to moderate levels of cortisol,\" said Fargo. \"If you're seeing structural brain changes in midlife, you can imagine what is happening by the time you get old enough to develop dementia.\"\r\nInterestingly, the effects of high cortisol on cerebral brain volume appeared to only affect women, not men.\r\n\"Estrogen can increase cortisol,\" said Dr. Richard Isaacson, who directs the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medicine, \"and about 40% of the women in the study's high cortisol group were on hormone replacement.\" Isaacson was not involved in the study.\r\n\r\nSeshadri said the study did adjust for the use of hormone replacement therapy.\r\n\"That does not completely rule out an adverse impact of estrogen replacement,\" Seshadri said, \"but makes it less likely to the main story.\"\r\n\r\nSeshadri also emphasized the study results only show an association, not a cause, and more research is needed to tease out the relationship between high cortisol levels and dementia. While that is occurring, she suggests people consider lifestyle modifications to combat the stress of modern life.\r\nFargo agrees. \"We know, for example, that people who exercise throughout life have a lower risk of developing dementia,\" he said. \"Take some time for yourself. Do some meditation. There are ways to control stress that will lead to a beneficial outcome.\"",

        "claim": "In early October 2023, a new study was released proving that the higher a country\u2019s vaccination rate is, the higher the excess death rate in that country will be.",
        "original_reasoning_text": "We checked on Our World in Data (OWID) website what the excess mortality rate in the selected countries was (the viral graph mentioned only eight countries: Bulgaria, Poland, Sweden, Germany, UK, New Zealand, Australia, and U.S.A.). When we compared the 2023 data from the website's chart titled \"Excess mortality: Cumulative deaths from all causes compared to projection based on previous years,\" it turned out that it did not match the percentages shown in the viral post. For instance, the order of countries sorted by the excess mortality rate was different. \r\n\r\nThe second aspect of the viral \"Excess Deaths in 2023 plotted against COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake\" graph was the percentage of the population that was vaccinated. OWID website data showed similar numbers when we compared it with the in-question graph, as, for instance, Bulgaria and Poland had the lowest percentage of their populations vaccinated, and both graphs showed that 81% of the U.S. population received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Importantly, however, it did not confirm that the higher a country's vaccination rate was, the higher the excess deaths rate was in that country.\r\n\r\nTaking the example of Bulgaria, with an excess mortality rate of 21.25% in January 2023, and 16.24% as of August 2023 (the highest excess mortality rate among the selected countries), Bulgaria was also the country with the lowest percentage of its population having received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine (31.09% as of June 2023). In simple words, out of the eight countries mentioned in the viral posts, Bulgaria was the \"least vaccinated\" country, and had the highest excess mortality rate. However, such a simple comparison of the two numbers is not how scientists would investigate a correlation. Most importantly, we have not found any study that proved a country's high vaccination rate correlated with a higher number of excess deaths. \r\n\r\nMoreover, a study published in 2022 with the title \"Higher COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Are Associated with Lower COVID-19 Mortality: A Global Analysis,\" as the title indicated, concluded the exact opposite. The research found that countries with higher vaccination rates experienced lower COVID-19 mortality rates. Specifically, a 10-percentage-point increase in vaccination was linked to an 18.1% decrease in mortality after 6 months and a 16.8% decrease after 12 months. Additionally, a 10-percentage-point rise in booster vaccination rates correlated with a 33.1% reduction in COVID-19 mortality.\r\n\r\nGiven that no scientific study was released that proved \"that the higher a country's vaccination rate, the higher the excess deaths,\" we have rated this claim as False.",

        "justification": "The evaluation of \"False\" for this news item is justified because there is no credible scientific evidence supporting a direct correlation between higher vaccination rates and higher excess deaths at the country level. In fact, multiple studies and public health data from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and independent scientific research show that higher COVID-19 vaccination rates are associated with lower rates of severe disease, hospitalization, and mortality related to COVID-19.\n\nClaims suggesting that vaccination increases excess deaths commonly misuse or misunderstand data, ignore confounding factors (such as the timing of pandemic waves, different healthcare capacities, or age demographics), or cherry-pick statistics from unreliable sources. Peer-reviewed analyses have repeatedly shown that vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective. Furthermore, countries with high vaccination coverage, such as Portugal and New Zealand, have generally had lower excess mortality than those with lower coverage.\n\nIn summary, the news item is false because it contradicts rigorous scientific analysis and public health records globally, which demonstrate that vaccines reduce, not increase, excess deaths."

        "claim": "The CDC stated in late summer 2023 that Americans who had received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were at higher risk of infection from new variants of the virus than those who were unvaccinated.",
        "original_reasoning_text": "The rumor emerged after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a \"Risk Assessment Summary for SARS CoV-2 Sublineage BA.2.86\" on Aug. 23, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the summary explained what variants of viruses are with regard to a new one identified in several countries the previous week:\r\n\r\nAll viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), change over time. These viruses with changes are called \"variants.\"  These changes can affect how contagious a virus is, how well it responds to treatment, and how severely it affects people. Last week, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 called BA.2.86 was detected in samples from people in Denmark and Israel. At least two cases have been identified in the United States. This variant is notable because it has multiple genetic differences from previous versions of SARS-CoV-2.\r\n\r\nIt was the \"Current Risk Assesment\" section of the document that sparked discussion on social media (emphasis ours):\r\n\r\nBased on what CDC knows now, existing tests used to detect and medications used to treat COVID-19 appear to be effective with this variant. BA.2.86 may be more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines. Scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of the forthcoming, updated COVID-19 vaccine. CDC's current assessment is that this updated vaccine will be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization. \r\n\r\nThe sentence about the new variant being \"more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines\" did not compare vaccinated individuals to the unvaccinated. The summary stated that those who had previously been infected or vaccinated may be more susceptible to this variant compared to previous variants.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the document, the CDC explained that the mutations could impact the immunity derived from vaccines compared with other variants (emphasis ours):\r\n\r\n    The large number of mutations in this variant raises concerns of greater escape from existing immunity from vaccines and previous infections compared with other recent variants. For example, one analysis of mutations suggests the difference may be as large as or greater than that between BA.2 and XBB.1.5, which circulated nearly a year apart. However, virus samples are not yet broadly available for more reliable laboratory testing of antibodies, and it is too soon to know the real-world impacts on immunity. Nearly all the U.S. population has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from vaccination, previous infection, or both, and it is likely that these antibodies will continue to provide some protection against severe disease from this variant. This is an area of ongoing scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nGiven that the CDC had not stated that individuals who had received the COVID-19 vaccine were more susceptible to the new variant than those who had not been vaccinated, we have rated this claim as \"False.\"",

They point out that CO2 also contributes to oxidative stress, which can affect cognition and cause testicular issues in men.\r\n\r\nBut independent doctors have questioned the conclusions of the study \u2014 which never directly looked at health complications and mask use, describing the link as 'unlikely'.\r\n\r\nAlluding to the surge in stillbirths during the pandemic, the German researchers said: 'Circumstantial evidence exists that popular mask use may be related to current observations of a significant rise of 28 percent to 33 percent in stillbirths worldwide.'\r\n\r\n'[And] reduced verbal, motor, and overall cognitive performance of two full standard deviations in scores in children born during the pandemic,' the researchers wrote in the paper, published in the journal Heliyon.\r\n\r\nBut the study could not conclusively prove that the masks were directly responsible for any of these complications.\r\n\r\nDr Stuart Fischer, an emergency care physician in New York, questioned whether there was a 'toxic buildup' of CO2. \r\n\r\nHe said: 'I wouldn\u2019t say this happens, because the body adjusts the pH, the acid/base balance very quickly. Respiratory acidosis due to facemasks is unlikely although short-term side effects might affect people with chronic lung disease.'\r\n\r\nThe German research team gathered data from 43 previously published studies on exposure to CO2, mask-wearing and pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThey found that after wearing a mask for more than five minutes, CO2 levels in the inhaled air rose to between 1.4 percent and 3.2 percent.\r\n\r\nOne mask study conducted in Germany, researchers measured the CO2 concentration of air behind surgical masks worn by 15 healthy men. Within 30 minutes, the CO2 concentration rose to roughly 2.8-3.2 percent.\r\n\r\nIn another study in Italy, scientists measured the air under surgical masks worn in a lab and found a concentration between 0.22 and 0.29 percent within five minutes. \r\n\r\nMasks provide breathing resistance and create a dead space that traps CO2, leading to more inhaled and re-breathed CO2, the reviewers said.\r\n\r\nThe gas makes up around 0.04 percent of all inhaled air, for comparison, and the  Department of Agriculture said safe levels should be below 0.5 percent for eight-hour exposure.\r\n\r\nThe researchers then looked at studies that focused on the effect of similar CO2 levels on animals such as mice and rats.\r\n\r\nMammals such as mice and rats with prolonged exposed to 0.3 percent carbon dioxide gave birth to offspring which had 'irreversible neuron damage', the review found.\r\n\r\nIn total, the researchers looked at studies dating back from the start of the scientific databases they searched until November 30, 2021. \r\n\r\nThe main caveat of the research is that the studies looking at the potential toxic effects of carbon dioxide are animal studies - because these experiments would not be ethical in humans. \r\n\r\nThe researchers also noted that none of the studies in their review looked directly at mask use and miscarriages, infertility and neurodevelopment disorders.\r\n\r\nThe researchers also noted that the exact effects of toxic levels of CO2 on unborn life is not known in great detail.\r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide is known to contribute to oxidative stress, which the researchers suggested would hinder fetal development. \r\n\r\nDr Kevin Bass, cell and molecular biology PhD student, said on Twitter that the new paper was 'explosive'.\r\n\r\nBut he said: 'We do not have any good evidence in pregnant women... of the long-term effects of mask-wearing and therefore no evidence that these effects occur in women.'\r\n\r\nHe added: 'All we have are animal studies and a clear indication that changes in CO2 concentrations do occur in mask-wearing women.'\r\n\r\nStillbirths and pregnancy complications rose during the Covid pandemic, and preeclampsia and other pregnancy complications were blamed on the virus.\r\n\r\nFactors other than mask-wearing are likely to be at play, such as hospital closures and delayed care. \r\n\r\nIt comes after three years of fierce debate about the effectiveness of masks.\r\n\r\nThe biggest review by the Cochrane Institute, the 'gold standard' of evidence-based reviews, based in London, found they made little to no difference to infections but smaller studies suggest there is a lower risk of catching Covid.\r\n\r\nMask mandates on transportation systems in America were backed by penalties of up to $3,000 for repeat offenders.\r\n\r\nFormer director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr Anthony Fauci initially advised people not to wear masks, which he later claimed because he was concerned there would not be enough for healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nHe went on to advise that everyone should wear a mask.",

The claim that masks lead to \u201cirreversible neuron damage\u201d or other serious risks comes from studies where mice or rats were exposed to certain CO2 levels, not people or pregnant women.\n- Although wearing masks slightly increases inhaled CO2, scientific reviews (including those by the CDC and OSHA) indicate levels remain well below dangerous thresholds for healthy individuals. Most peer-reviewed studies have found that mask-induced CO2 increases are not clinically significant.\n- There is no direct evidence linking mask usage in humans to stillbirths or cognitive decline. Correlation during the pandemic is more plausibly explained by other stressors (e.g., COVID-19 infection, reduced healthcare access).\n- Experts quoted in the news itself dispute the causal connection.\n\nTherefore, while the article refers to some real studies on CO2 levels under masks and animal research, it overstates the relevance and certainty of these findings for human health, especially in the general population\u2014hence, \u201cpartially false.\u201d"

Of this, 1,106,079 deaths are considered to be \u201cexcess,\u201d based on the five-year average from 2015 to 2019.\r\nOther government data confirms that mortality rates per 100,000 people are highest among the \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d population, suggesting covid injections are the cause of all this excess mortality.

First, race was only one of several factors used in clinical scoring systems; it did not automatically grant treatment or deny it to others. Secondly, being nonwhite was not \"more important\" than hypertension; whereas hypertension gave 1 point, nonwhite race or Hispanic ethnicity gave 2 points, similar to other comorbidities like diabetes. Importantly, this system aimed to address known health disparities, not to discriminate.\n\nThe claim that Walz \u201ckilled\u201d people based on these criteria is unfounded speculation without evidence. There is no data demonstrating that any patient died as a result of these triage guidelines.

Wisdom teeth are third molars located at the back of the mouth, and their removal is a common dental procedure with well-established risks and benefits, none of which include direct impacts on heart health.\n\nFurthermore, while \u201cmeridian lines\u201d are a concept from traditional Chinese medicine, this idea is not recognized or validated by modern anatomy or physiology. There is no evidence that dental procedures \u201cmess with the pathways of the body\u201d as described. No medical literature links manipulating these so-called meridian lines in the teeth to systemic health issues or heart problems.\n\nAuthoritative dental and medical sources (such as the American Dental Association and Mayo Clinic) confirm that wisdom tooth extraction does not cause heart disease. Any suggestion otherwise is misinformation. Therefore, the claim in the news item is unequivocally false."

Skeleton of a two-headed giant found, a revelation that changed history\r\n\r\nIn an extraordinary breakthrough that has left the scientific community in shock, archaeologists working deep in the Amazon Rainforest have uncovered the skeletal remains of a two-headed giant. This unprecedented discovery is rewriting what we know about the history of human evolution and our understanding of life on Earth.\r\n\r\nDuring a routine excavation aimed at uncovering remnants of ancient indigenous tribes, scientists stumbled upon something far more extraordinary than they could have ever anticipated. Beneath layers of dense jungle soil, they unearthed an enormous skeleton \u2014 but this was no ordinary human skeleton. It was massive, and most shockingly, it had two fully formed skulls attached to a single, towering humanoid body.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton, measuring nearly 15 feet tall, had an intricate bone structure with two skulls connected to an expansive ribcage and spine. The discovery site became an immediate focus for archaeologists and anthropologists from around the world, who rushed to the Amazon to witness the skeleton of what is now believed to be the remains of a two-headed giant.\r\n\r\nThe skeletal remains have left experts baffled. Not only does the two-headed structure defy known human anatomy, but the size and proportions of the skeleton are unlike anything ever recorded. The two skulls, perfectly symmetrical and intact, suggest that this being may have had two independent minds. The skeletal frame itself reveals elongated limbs and robust bones, hinting at incredible strength and size during life.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Dr. Elena Santos, the lead archaeologist on the excavation team. \u201cThis find challenges everything we thought we knew about human evolution. The fact that the skeleton has two heads and a body structure so massive is beyond explanation using current scientific understanding.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this two-headed giant raises profound questions about ancient civilizations and the history of human species. Some researchers believe this could be evidence of an entirely different branch of human evolution, while others speculate about the possibility of hybrid species or even extraterrestrial origins.\r\n\r\nAncient texts and myths from various cultures around the world have long hinted at the existence of giants, sometimes even two-headed beings. Until now, these tales were considered mere folklore. But this skeleton has provided the first concrete evidence that such beings may have actually existed.\r\n\r\nThis discovery could have far-reaching implications, not just for the field of archaeology, but for all of science. If this two-headed giant was part of a once-thriving population, it could mean that Earth has seen the rise and fall of multiple advanced civilizations\u2014some of which may have possessed capabilities or knowledge lost to time.\r\n\r\nAs scientists continue to study the remains, further investigations are expected to shed light on the origins of this remarkable skeleton. Could it be a rare genetic mutation? Or could this be the long-lost evidence of an ancient race of giants? The answers to these questions could dramatically change the course of human history.\r\n\r\nNews of the two-headed giant discovery has sparked intense curiosity and speculation worldwide. Conspiracy theorists have begun to propose far-reaching ideas about lost civilizations, while others believe this discovery could provide clues to humanity\u2019s ancient connection with the cosmos.\r\n\r\nThe Amazon Rainforest, known for its rich biodiversity and hidden secrets, has once again revealed a mystery of epic proportions.

Generally, annual global wildfire emissions are estimated at about 6\u20138 Gt per year, still a small fraction compared to century-scale human emissions. Furthermore, most vegetation burned by wildfires regrows, reabsorbing much of the released carbon over time, whereas fossil fuel emissions accumulate in the atmosphere.

However, multiple life-cycle analyses (such as those published by the International Council on Clean Transportation and the European Environment Agency) indicate that emissions from battery manufacturing are typically equivalent to driving a conventional petrol car for approximately 1.5 to 3.5 years, depending on factors like the battery size, energy mix in battery production, and vehicle efficiency. \n\nStudies do not support the \"eight years\" figure; that overstates the environmental cost of battery manufacture. Furthermore, although electric vehicles (EVs) have higher initial emissions due to battery production, their overall lifetime emissions are usually much lower than those of petrol vehicles, especially when charged with cleaner electricity. The news item thus misrepresents credible scientific findings by significantly inflating the emissions from battery manufacturing, warranting a \"partially false\" rating."

Some river water is released to maintain ecosystem health, but this process is vital for preserving endangered fish species and water quality; it does not equate to wasting massive amounts of water that could otherwise be used to fight fires. Firefighting typically uses local water sources (such as reservoirs, lakes, and groundwater); firefighting is not limited or inhibited by the diversion of water for environmental purposes.\n\nMultiple sources, including Cal Fire and environmental agencies, have clarified that no significant amount of water that could be used for firefighting is being diverted to the ocean in a way that impacts wildfire containment.

The existence of space is a well-established fact, supported by centuries of astronomical observation, satellite technology, and international collaboration, such as the International Space Station (ISS), manned spaceflights, and images from space probes. Thousands of satellites are in orbit around Earth, performing functions like GPS, weather forecasting, and telecommunications; their orbits can be tracked in real time by anyone with the appropriate equipment or via public websites (e.g., CelesTrak, N2YO).\n\nWhile there are scientific balloons used for high-altitude research, they do not reach the altitudes or perform the functions of satellites in space. The assertion that all satellites are mere balloons is easily disproved by physics (balloons cannot stay in stable Earth orbit), visual evidence (amateur astronomers and professionals regularly observe satellites), and the technical realities of satellite communication. Therefore, the statement is clearly false."

Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, it\u2019s been a long time coming for this order.\r\nTrump had placed a call to Russia to ask about \u201cany and all\u201d files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled \u201cBlocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.\u201d <annotate_paragraph>\r\n\r\n Nearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did \u201cundermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.\u201d Due to Soros\u2019s illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives, Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didn\u2019t President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? It\u2019s because Soros flooded Obama and Hillary\u2019s Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?\r\nSoros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared \u201cit is the central focus of my life\u201d and \u201ca matter of life and death\u201d to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillary\u2019s highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.\r\nNow that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying \u201cdemocracy is now in crisis.\u201d Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible, During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent. These protesters started riots, went up against the police force, and generally made life difficult for law-abiding citizens. Then came a report that Soros was paying these protesters around $15 an hour to protest, and they would have their expenses paid for.\r\nIt didn\u2019t just stop at the Black Lives Matter protests either. There were several protests against Trump during the election season that turned violent. Again, another report circulated that protesters were getting paid to cause as much destruction as possible, Considering that one of these protests actually shut down a speech that Trump had planned to make, it\u2019s safe to say that they were effective at the time. Not to mention that these people were endangering other people around them and creating a lot of problems for the police forces that were assigned to them.\r\nIt\u2019s about time that Trump did something against Soros. This man has been responsible for funding protests that have turned violent in the United States. He has been responsible for attempting to control the Democrats through his donations to the Party. This man is a menace to society, and Trump is finally labeling Soros like he should be: a \u201cNational Security Threat\" Other nations are starting to do something against Soros as well. Hungary became the first nation to come forward and do what they could to bring down Soros. Hungary said that they will use \u201call the tools at its disposal\u201d to \u201csweep out\u201d various NGOs that are tied to Soros. In other words, his wealth won\u2019t be able to influence government positions anymore.\r\n\r\n Again, Soros has done what he could to help finance and protest against Trump\u2019s inauguration. A report came out that showed he was directly tied to over 50 groups that were set to protest the inauguration of Trump.

For example, CNN and The Guardian covered stories about police in Melbourne, Florida, discovering at least two separate packages suspected to be cocaine on beaches after the storm passed. One brick of cocaine was found at Paradise Beach Park, and another duffel bag containing multiple bricks was found at another location, each confirmed by authorities to have tested positive for cocaine. This phenomenon occasionally occurs when rough weather disrupts drug-smuggling routes at sea, leading packages to be lost overboard or intentionally discarded. Law enforcement agencies responded promptly, warning the public not to handle such packages. Therefore, the claim aligns with verifiable, widely reported facts from reputable sources."

Historical data clearly show that measles mortality dropped dramatically only after the introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s and 1970s, as documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and peer-reviewed studies.

Measles can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, permanent disability, and death.

With access to advanced neural interface technology from his company Neuralink, Elon offered a radical solution. A prototype device that could reconnect and stimulate the brain\u2019s neural pathways, potentially waking Tristan from his year long sleep.\r\nThe procedure was delicate and unprecedented. Elon personally supervised the team, working with the world\u2019s top neuroscientists and engineers. The Neuralink implant was surgically placed, mapping Tristan\u2019s brain activity and gently stimulating key areas linked to consciousness. For days, the device sent signal, quiet pulses of hope. Then, on the seventh morning, Tristan opened his eyes. He blinked, looked around the room, and whispered, \u201cMom?\u201d Cheers broke out. Not only was he awake, he was fully restored, speaking clearly, remembering everything, even walking within hours.\r\nNews of the miracle spread globally throughout the medical community. Doctors called it a breakthrough in coma recovery science. Tristan\u2019s recovery was complete, no brain damage, no lingering effects, just an energetic boy full of life. Elon Musk is hailed as a hero, not just for his genius, but for his compassion. At a press conference, Tristan hugged Elon tightly and said, \u201cYou gave me back my life.\u201d Elon simply smiled and replied, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot more living to do, kid.\u201d",

Including returns, cases in which noncitizens left the U.S. voluntarily or after withdrawing their application for admission without undergoing formal removal proceedings, the total number of departures exceeded 5 million.\r\n\r\nClaims that 75% to 83% of those deported \"never saw a judge or had a chance to plead their case\" are based on statistics from individual years, particularly 2012 and 2013. These percentages refer to so-called \"summary removals\" carried out through legal procedures such as \"expedited removal\" and \"reinstatement of removal,\" which do not involve a hearing before an immigration judge. From 2009 to 2016, these two categories combined made up anywhere between 58% and 84% of all formal removals annually, averaging about 74% over the entire period. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we rate this claim as mostly true.",

Reliable sources, including data from the Department of Homeland Security and analyses by immigration watchdogs (e.g., Migration Policy Institute, Pew Research), confirm that during President Obama's tenure, over 3 million removals/deportations occurred. The majority\u201475\u201383%\u2014were categorized as \u201cremovals\u201d but were actually fast-track processes, such as \u201cexpedited removal\u201d and \u201cvoluntary return,\u201d predominantly at the border. These processes do not involve formal hearings before immigration judges.\n\nThis pattern predates Obama; under Presidents Clinton and Bush, similar expedited removal methods were used, and most deportees did not get judicial hearings. Immigration experts verify that U.S. law permits authorities to remove certain unauthorized entrants without a judge's review, especially if caught near the border or within days of entry.\n\nWhile the comment about \"outrage\" is opinion-based, the factual claims about historic practice and legal processes for deportation are well-supported. No president, including Trump, has been required to obtain court permission before most removals at the border, confirming this is long-standing policy rather than unique to any administration."

Instead, the Act restricts advertising unproven cures for cancer and prohibits anyone except registered medical professionals from offering cancer treatment or claiming to cure cancer for profit or publicity. Its purpose was to protect the public from fraudulent or dangerous treatments, not to criminalize legitimate cancer research, treatment, or advice from qualified practitioners. There is no evidence that medical practitioners are prosecuted or jailed merely for attempting to cure cancer; prosecutions occur only for making false or unsubstantiated claims outside medical standards. The Act is not applied in the US, and cancer charities are legally permitted to fundraise for cure research. The claim that discussing or publicizing cancer cures is a criminal act fundamentally misrepresents the law\u2019s intent and practice.

While cell lines derived decades ago from two elective abortions (not recent or repeated abortions) were historically used to grow some live virus vaccines, no actual fetal tissue or \"debris\" remains in the final vaccine product. The amount of residual DNA fragments is extremely small, thoroughly purified, and poses no health risk.\n\n2. **Mennonite stance on vaccination:** The assertion that Mennonites, particularly in Texas, widely object to vaccines due to these reasons is misleading. While some Mennonite groups may decline vaccination for various reasons, many Mennonite communities do vaccinate, and there is no singular doctrinal ban on vaccines, nor a widespread objection based on the false claim about fetal \"debris.\"\n\n3. **CDC approach to treatment:** The claim that the CDC asserts \"the only thing we have is vaccination\" and ignores treatment is inaccurate. The CDC emphasizes prevention via vaccination because it is the most effective measure against diseases like measles, for which there is no specific antiviral treatment. Supportive care is always recommended, but there are no alternative treatments equivalent to immunization.\n\nThese points collectively support the \"False\" evaluation."
