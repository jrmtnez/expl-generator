The study found that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke can produce detectable levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine, minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate subjective drug effects, and minor impairment in cognitive performance.  The study also found that room ventilation significantly reduced the levels of exposure among nonsmokers, resulting in much lower levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine, and no subjective effects or impairment in cognitive performance.  The study's findings suggest that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke can result in absorption of cannabinoids, which can lead to minor impairments in cognitive performance and subjective effects. However, the impairments were mild and temporary, and the study did not find any significant long-term effects of secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke.  The study's results are consistent with previous research on the topic and provide further evidence that secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke can have effects on individuals who do not smoke themselves. The study's findings may be useful for policymakers and public health officials who are trying to understand the risks associated with secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke.

Meaning my husband can get cavities from me having them. Is this true?!?!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew research reveals that dental caries, also known as cavities or tooth decay, is actually an infectious disease ... The bacteria most responsible for tooth decay are Steptococcus mutans and Steptococcus sobrinus. These bacteria are passed easily from person to person.\r\n\r\nResearch is finding that this bacteria is passed easily from adults to children when kissing, sharing utensils or any other activity that transmits saliva. Streptococcus mutans is not passed to each other as adults, so children, especially ages 6 to 36 months of age, are particularly susceptible.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, December 2016",

This suggests that the article presents some true information, but also contains some false or misleading claims.  The first sentence, according to Liliana Rozo, D.D.S., assistant professor at the University of Louisville School of Dentistry, states that tooth decay can have a detrimental effect on a child's quality of life, performance in school, and success in life. This is partially true. While tooth decay can indeed have negative impacts on oral health and overall well-being, it is not directly related to the contagiousness of cavities.  The second sentence claims that cavities are contagious, which is partially false. Cavities are not directly contagious, meaning they cannot be spread from person to person through casual contact. However, oral bacteria can be transmitted through various means such as poor oral hygiene, sharing food and drinks, or contaminated surfaces.  The third sentence states that poor oral health may be a risk factor for systemic disease. This is partially true. Research has shown that poor oral health has been linked to various systemic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory infections.  The fourth sentence claims that mothers with cavities can transmit caries-producing oral",

The article correctly reports on the findings of this study, showing how a daily intake of 248 mg of magnesium resulted in improvement of depression symptoms. It is also true that antidepressants come with some problematic side effects. That said, it is hard to say from the study whether magnesium works better than antidepressants, or that it can replace antidepressants (as suggested in the headline, which misinterprets the study). The patients in the study were all on different therapies (some on antidepressants, some on other therapies, while others had no treatment at all). A study with a more uniform population and a placebo group would be needed to make this comparison. It would have been good if the article provided more links to other studies supporting its claims, such as magnesium\u2019s effect on physical health. The article does over-sell magnesium\u2019s health benefits somewhat \u2013 there are downsides to excess magnesium intake that it should warn people about, such as diarrhea and cramping, especially since it encourages the taking of magnesium supplements.",

The news item appears to be based on a study that found that the tops of soda cans are more contaminated than public toilets. However, it is unclear if this study actually found that the contamination was caused by rat urine, as the news item claims. The language used is sensational and alarmist, stating that rat urine contains \"toxic and deathly substances\" and that the dried urine on a soda can is \"toxic and obviously lethal\". This type of language is not typical of a scientific study and suggests that the news item may be exaggerating or misrepresenting the findings of the study. Additionally, there is no evidence provided to support the claim that rat urine is capable of causing Leptospirosis.   It is worth noting that Leptospirosis is a serious bacterial infection caused by exposure to the urine of infected animals, such as rats. However, it is not typically spread through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, such as soda cans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state that Leptospirosis is typically spread through contact with the urine of infected animals, usually through breaks in the skin or through contact with contaminated water or food.

What the viral campaign markets as sour honey actually refers to a substance termed propolis, which is a substance created by bees and described in a 2016 study that sought to uncover its chemical variability. Having cleared that up, we can turn to the medical claims. In general, they overstate the implications of legitimate (though limited) laboratory investigations and animal studies. More accurately, it would valid to say that some specific chemicals identified in Brazilian propolis may have potential as a cancer therapy if the results of animal or cell-line studies are shown to hold relevance to humans. From a basic fact checking standpoint, the above chemicals are present in the forms of propolis listed above. And indeed, animal studies of artepillin-C from Brazilian propolis have demonstrated potential in fighting breast or prostate cancer. CAPE sourced from propolis has been shown to be effective at inhibiting the growth of breast cancer in cell line studies. Brazilian red propolis, in general, has been shown to combat colon cancer in studies as well. Whether or not these studies hold relevance to humans remains to be seen, but it is important to note that the above studies, for the most part, have tested isolated chemicals in regulated doses, and the chemical makeup of propolis varies considerably sample by sample. This is one of many issues that would need to be resolved before it could become a true therapy.",

Amygdalin is a naturally occurring compound that can be found in a variety of foods, most notably bitter almonds and the pits of apricots and other fruits.

Overshadowing this unceasing onslaught quacktastic red flags are two hard truths: 1) there is effectively no evidence that laetrile, amygdalin, B17, etc., have any efficacy as a cancer treatment for humans and 2) there is plenty of evidence to suggest that amygdalin and related compounds are extremely toxic to humans, a problem compounded by the fact that several studies have shown that amygdalin supplements vary wildly in the accuracy of their concentrations and are completely unregulated.",

The article claims that dioxins are \"highly poisonous to the cells of our bodies.\" While it is true that dioxins are toxic and can cause health problems, the statement is an exaggeration. Dioxins are not \"highly poisonous\" to all cells, but rather can cause harm to certain cells and tissues. 2. The article claims that freezing plastic bottles with water in them releases dioxins from the plastic. This claim is partially false. Freezing plastic bottles with water in them may not necessarily release dioxins, and there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. 3. The article claims that many people are unaware of the dangers of reusing plastic bottles. This claim is partially true, as many people may not be aware of the potential health risks associated with reusing plastic bottles. However, it is not accurate to say that \"many are unaware of poisoning caused by re-using plastic bottles\" without specifying what kind of poisoning and under what circumstances. 4.

The news title suggests that asparagus may have a preventative effect on hangovers. However, the veracity of the news is labeled as \"partially false\". This already raises some red flags.  Upon examining the sentences and subject-predicate-object triplets, we find that some statements are partially false or partially true. For instance, the sentence \"Eating asparagus before you start drinking can help protect your liver\" is partially false. This implies that eating asparagus may not necessarily protect one's liver, but perhaps it might have some effect.  The sentence \"Its minerals and amino acids not only protect the liver from toxins, the enzymes in asparagus can help break down the alcohol and alleviate hangovers\" is true, according to the veracity label. This suggests that asparagus does contain certain compounds that can help with hangover symptoms.  The subject-predicate-object triplets further support this conclusion.

When we compared the 2023 data from the website's chart titled \"Excess mortality: Cumulative deaths from all causes compared to projection based on previous years,\" it turned out that it did not match the percentages shown in the viral post. For instance, the order of countries sorted by the excess mortality rate was different. \r\n\r\nThe second aspect of the viral \"Excess Deaths in 2023 plotted against COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake\" graph was the percentage of the population that was vaccinated. OWID website data showed similar numbers when we compared it with the in-question graph, as, for instance, Bulgaria and Poland had the lowest percentage of their populations vaccinated, and both graphs showed that 81% of the U.S. population received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Importantly, however, it did not confirm that the higher a country's vaccination rate was, the higher the excess deaths rate was in that country.\r\n\r\nTaking the example of Bulgaria, with an excess mortality rate of 21.25% in January 2023, and 16.24% as of August 2023 (the highest excess mortality rate among the selected countries), Bulgaria was also the country with the lowest percentage of its population having received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine (31.09% as of June 2023). In simple words, out of the eight countries mentioned in the viral posts, Bulgaria was the \"least vaccinated\" country, and had the highest excess mortality rate. However, such a simple comparison of the two numbers is not how scientists would investigate a correlation. Most importantly, we have not found any study that proved a country's high vaccination rate correlated with a higher number of excess deaths. \r\n\r\nMoreover, a study published in 2022 with the title \"Higher COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Are Associated with Lower COVID-19 Mortality: A Global Analysis,\" as the title indicated, concluded the exact opposite. The research found that countries with higher vaccination rates experienced lower COVID-19 mortality rates. Specifically, a 10-percentage-point increase in vaccination was linked to an 18.1% decrease in mortality after 6 months and a 16.8% decrease after 12 months. Additionally, a 10-percentage-point rise in booster vaccination rates correlated with a 33.1% reduction in COVID-19 mortality.\r\n\r\nGiven that no scientific study was released that proved \"that the higher a country's vaccination rate, the higher the excess deaths,\" we have rated this claim as False.",

        "item_class": "F",
        "original_reasoning_text": "The rumor emerged after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a \"Risk Assessment Summary for SARS CoV-2 Sublineage BA.2.86\" on Aug. 23, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the summary explained what variants of viruses are with regard to a new one identified in several countries the previous week:\r\n\r\nAll viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), change over time. These viruses with changes are called \"variants.\"  These changes can affect how contagious a virus is, how well it responds to treatment, and how severely it affects people. Last week, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 called BA.2.86 was detected in samples from people in Denmark and Israel. At least two cases have been identified in the United States. This variant is notable because it has multiple genetic differences from previous versions of SARS-CoV-2.\r\n\r\nIt was the \"Current Risk Assesment\" section of the document that sparked discussion on social media (emphasis ours):\r\n\r\nBased on what CDC knows now, existing tests used to detect and medications used to treat COVID-19 appear to be effective with this variant. BA.2.86 may be more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines. Scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of the forthcoming, updated COVID-19 vaccine. CDC's current assessment is that this updated vaccine will be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization. \r\n\r\nThe sentence about the new variant being \"more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines\" did not compare vaccinated individuals to the unvaccinated. The summary stated that those who had previously been infected or vaccinated may be more susceptible to this variant compared to previous variants.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the document, the CDC explained that the mutations could impact the immunity derived from vaccines compared with other variants (emphasis ours):\r\n\r\n    The large number of mutations in this variant raises concerns of greater escape from existing immunity from vaccines and previous infections compared with other recent variants. For example, one analysis of mutations suggests the difference may be as large as or greater than that between BA.2 and XBB.1.5, which circulated nearly a year apart. However, virus samples are not yet broadly available for more reliable laboratory testing of antibodies, and it is too soon to know the real-world impacts on immunity. Nearly all the U.S. population has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from vaccination, previous infection, or both, and it is likely that these antibodies will continue to provide some protection against severe disease from this variant. This is an area of ongoing scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nGiven that the CDC had not stated that individuals who had received the COVID-19 vaccine were more susceptible to the new variant than those who had not been vaccinated, we have rated this claim as \"False.\"",

A malignant neoplasm, or cancerous tumor, usually grows rapidly and can spread into other parts of the body, such as the lymphatic system, blood, or bone marrow.This is part of a process known as metastasis, and it's what makes cancer so dangerous.",
