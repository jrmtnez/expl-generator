The article itself states that the 2013 study found that medical marijuana quieted symptoms in most participants and contributed to complete remission in about half of the participants, but it does not claim that it leads to complete remission. Additionally, the other sentences in the article are also labeled as \"false\", indicating that they are not supported by evidence.  Furthermore, the article's claim that the plant's high THC relaxes inflamed parts of the body, allowing patients relief from pain without any negative side effects, is also not supported by evidence. While THC may have some therapeutic benefits, it is not a proven cure for Crohn's disease, and its effects on the body are not as straightforward as claimed in the article.

The study also found that room ventilation significantly reduced the levels of exposure among nonsmokers, resulting in much lower levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine, and no subjective effects or impairment in cognitive performance.  The study's findings suggest that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke can result in absorption of cannabinoids, which can lead to minor impairments in cognitive performance and subjective effects. However, the impairments were mild and temporary, and the study did not find any significant long-term effects of secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke.  The study's results are consistent with previous research on the topic and provide further evidence that secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke can have effects on individuals who do not smoke themselves.

This is partially true. While tooth decay can indeed have negative impacts on oral health and overall well-being, it is not directly related to the contagiousness of cavities.  The second sentence claims that cavities are contagious, which is partially false. Cavities are not directly contagious, meaning they cannot be spread from person to person through casual contact. However, oral bacteria can be transmitted through various means such as poor oral hygiene, sharing food and drinks, or contaminated surfaces.  The third sentence states that poor oral health may be a risk factor for systemic disease. This is partially true.

There is no reliable source cited to back up this claim. 2. Some of the sentences and statements made in the article are partially true, but taken out of context or exaggerated. For example, while pineapple does contain vitamin C, which has benefits for immune function and overall health, it is not a proven cure for all diseases, including cancer. 3. The article makes sweeping claims about the benefits of pineapple and bromelain without providing concrete evidence or scientific studies to support these claims. While bromelain does have anti-inflammatory properties, its effectiveness in treating various health conditions is still a topic of ongoing research and debate. 4.

Having cleared that up, we can turn to the medical claims. In general, they overstate the implications of legitimate (though limited) laboratory investigations and animal studies. More accurately, it would valid to say that some specific chemicals identified in Brazilian propolis may have potential as a cancer therapy if the results of animal or cell-line studies are shown to hold relevance to humans. From a basic fact checking standpoint, the above chemicals are present in the forms of propolis listed above. And indeed, animal studies of artepillin-C from Brazilian propolis have demonstrated potential in fighting breast or prostate cancer. CAPE sourced from propolis has been shown to be effective at inhibiting the growth of breast cancer in cell line studies. Brazilian red propolis, in general, has been shown to combat colon cancer in studies as well. Whether or not these studies hold relevance to humans remains to be seen, but it is important to note that the above studies, for the most part, have tested isolated chemicals in regulated doses, and the chemical makeup of propolis varies considerably sample by sample.

Studies have found that people with higher cortisol levels have smaller cerebrums and experience more memory loss. Additionally, the cerebrums are the two hemispheres of the brain, each responsible for distinct functions such as speech, emotions, and muscle functions. The combination of these findings justifies the conclusion that stress can indeed cause memory loss and brain shrinkage.",

Upon examining the sentences and subject-predicate-object triplets, we find that some statements are partially false or partially true. For instance, the sentence \"Eating asparagus before you start drinking can help protect your liver\" is partially false. This implies that eating asparagus may not necessarily protect one's liver, but perhaps it might have some effect.  The sentence \"Its minerals and amino acids not only protect the liver from toxins, the enzymes in asparagus can help break down the alcohol and alleviate hangovers\" is true, according to the veracity label. This suggests that asparagus does contain certain compounds that can help with hangover symptoms.  The subject-predicate-object triplets further support this conclusion.

When we compared the 2023 data from the website's chart titled \"Excess mortality: Cumulative deaths from all causes compared to projection based on previous years,\" it turned out that it did not match the percentages shown in the viral post. For instance, the order of countries sorted by the excess mortality rate was different. \r\n\r\nThe second aspect of the viral \"Excess Deaths in 2023 plotted against COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake\" graph was the percentage of the population that was vaccinated. OWID website data showed similar numbers when we compared it with the in-question graph, as, for instance, Bulgaria and Poland had the lowest percentage of their populations vaccinated, and both graphs showed that 81% of the U.S. population received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Importantly, however, it did not confirm that the higher a country's vaccination rate was, the higher the excess deaths rate was in that country.\r\n\r\nTaking the example of Bulgaria, with an excess mortality rate of 21.25% in January 2023, and 16.24% as of August 2023 (the highest excess mortality rate among the selected countries), Bulgaria was also the country with the lowest percentage of its population having received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine (31.09% as of June 2023). In simple words, out of the eight countries mentioned in the viral posts, Bulgaria was the \"least vaccinated\" country, and had the highest excess mortality rate. However, such a simple comparison of the two numbers is not how scientists would investigate a correlation. Most importantly, we have not found any study that proved a country's high vaccination rate correlated with a higher number of excess deaths. \r\n\r\nMoreover, a study published in 2022 with the title \"Higher COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Are Associated with Lower COVID-19 Mortality: A Global Analysis,\" as the title indicated, concluded the exact opposite. The research found that countries with higher vaccination rates experienced lower COVID-19 mortality rates.

Additionally, a 10-percentage-point rise in booster vaccination rates correlated with a 33.1% reduction in COVID-19 mortality.\r\n\r\nGiven that no scientific study was released that proved \"that the higher a country's vaccination rate, the higher the excess deaths,\" we have rated this claim as False.",

These viruses with changes are called \"variants.\"  These changes can affect how contagious a virus is, how well it responds to treatment, and how severely it affects people. Last week, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 called BA.2.86 was detected in samples from people in Denmark and Israel. At least two cases have been identified in the United States. This variant is notable because it has multiple genetic differences from previous versions of SARS-CoV-2.\r\n\r\nIt was the \"Current Risk Assesment\" section of the document that sparked discussion on social media (emphasis ours):\r\n\r\nBased on what CDC knows now, existing tests used to detect and medications used to treat COVID-19 appear to be effective with this variant. BA.2.86 may be more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines. Scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of the forthcoming, updated COVID-19 vaccine. CDC's current assessment is that this updated vaccine will be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization. \r\n\r\nThe sentence about the new variant being \"more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines\" did not compare vaccinated individuals to the unvaccinated. The summary stated that those who had previously been infected or vaccinated may be more susceptible to this variant compared to previous variants.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the document, the CDC explained that the mutations could impact the immunity derived from vaccines compared with other variants (emphasis ours):\r\n\r\n    The large number of mutations in this variant raises concerns of greater escape from existing immunity from vaccines and previous infections compared with other recent variants. For example, one analysis of mutations suggests the difference may be as large as or greater than that between BA.2 and XBB.1.5, which circulated nearly a year apart. However, virus samples are not yet broadly available for more reliable laboratory testing of antibodies, and it is too soon to know the real-world impacts on immunity. Nearly all the U.S. population has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from vaccination, previous infection, or both, and it is likely that these antibodies will continue to provide some protection against severe disease from this variant. This is an area of ongoing scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nGiven that the CDC had not stated that individuals who had received the COVID-19 vaccine were more susceptible to the new variant than those who had not been vaccinated, we have rated this claim as \"False.\"",
