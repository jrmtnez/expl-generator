The article itself states that the 2013 study found that medical marijuana quieted symptoms in most participants and contributed to complete remission in about half of the participants, but it does not claim that it leads to complete remission. Additionally, the other sentences in the article are also labeled as \"false\", indicating that they are not supported by evidence.  Furthermore, the article's claim that the plant's high THC relaxes inflamed parts of the body, allowing patients relief from pain without any negative side effects, is also not supported by evidence. While THC may have some therapeutic benefits, it is not a proven cure for Crohn's disease, and its effects on the body are not as straightforward as claimed in the article.

While magnesium has shown promise in addressing depression symptoms \u2013 specifically, a 2017 trial found that 248mg daily reduced anxiety and depression, and a 2023 review confirmed improvements in depression symptoms \u2013 the phrasing 'better than antidepressant drugs' is too strong. The data does not establish magnesium as a superior treatment, only a potentially beneficial supplement, especially for those with mild to moderate depression. Furthermore, the data acknowledges that antidepressants influence neurotransmitter processes in the brain and can potentially leave side effects, whereas magnesium's role is more nuanced and focused on supporting overall health, including cardiovascular and muscle function. Additionally, the information indicates conflicting views on the chemical basis of depression, with one source suggesting it's *not* a chemical imbalance and another stating it is.  The evidence highlights magnesium as a supportive element in mental health rather than a definitive replacement for established treatments.",

The patients in the study were all on different therapies (some on antidepressants, some on other therapies, while others had no treatment at all).

It would have been good if the article provided more links to other studies supporting its claims, such as magnesium\u2019s effect on physical health.

Having cleared that up, we can turn to the medical claims. In general, they overstate the implications of legitimate (though limited) laboratory investigations and animal studies. More accurately, it would valid to say that some specific chemicals identified in Brazilian propolis may have potential as a cancer therapy if the results of animal or cell-line studies are shown to hold relevance to humans. From a basic fact checking standpoint, the above chemicals are present in the forms of propolis listed above. And indeed, animal studies of artepillin-C from Brazilian propolis have demonstrated potential in fighting breast or prostate cancer. CAPE sourced from propolis has been shown to be effective at inhibiting the growth of breast cancer in cell line studies. Brazilian red propolis, in general, has been shown to combat colon cancer in studies as well. Whether or not these studies hold relevance to humans remains to be seen, but it is important to note that the above studies, for the most part, have tested isolated chemicals in regulated doses, and the chemical makeup of propolis varies considerably sample by sample.

No official pharmacopoeia lists it as a vitamin, and it does not possess any of the required characteristics of a vitamin. Amygdalin is a naturally occurring compound that can be found in a variety of foods, most notably bitter almonds and the pits of apricots and other fruits. Claims that it is a potential cancer therapy can be credited to the father and son team of Ernst Krebs Sr. (a doctor and pharmacist with a long history of promoting fringe folk remedies) and Ernst Krebs Jr. (who was not a doctor nor even the recipient of any degree in science, save an honorary doctorate from a now-defunct university). Overshadowing this unceasing onslaught quacktastic red flags are two hard truths: 1) there is effectively no evidence that laetrile, amygdalin, B17, etc., have any efficacy as a cancer treatment for humans and 2) there is plenty of evidence to suggest that amygdalin and related compounds are extremely toxic to humans, a problem compounded by the fact that several studies have shown that amygdalin supplements vary wildly in the accuracy of their concentrations and are completely unregulated.",

When we compared the 2023 data from the website's chart titled \"Excess mortality: Cumulative deaths from all causes compared to projection based on previous years,\" it turned out that it did not match the percentages shown in the viral post. For instance, the order of countries sorted by the excess mortality rate was different. \r\n\r\nThe second aspect of the viral \"Excess Deaths in 2023 plotted against COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake\" graph was the percentage of the population that was vaccinated. OWID website data showed similar numbers when we compared it with the in-question graph, as, for instance, Bulgaria and Poland had the lowest percentage of their populations vaccinated, and both graphs showed that 81% of the U.S. population received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Importantly, however, it did not confirm that the higher a country's vaccination rate was, the higher the excess deaths rate was in that country.\r\n\r\nTaking the example of Bulgaria, with an excess mortality rate of 21.25% in January 2023, and 16.24% as of August 2023 (the highest excess mortality rate among the selected countries), Bulgaria was also the country with the lowest percentage of its population having received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine (31.09% as of June 2023). In simple words, out of the eight countries mentioned in the viral posts, Bulgaria was the \"least vaccinated\" country, and had the highest excess mortality rate. However, such a simple comparison of the two numbers is not how scientists would investigate a correlation. Most importantly, we have not found any study that proved a country's high vaccination rate correlated with a higher number of excess deaths. \r\n\r\nMoreover, a study published in 2022 with the title \"Higher COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Are Associated with Lower COVID-19 Mortality: A Global Analysis,\" as the title indicated, concluded the exact opposite. The research found that countries with higher vaccination rates experienced lower COVID-19 mortality rates. Specifically, a 10-percentage-point increase in vaccination was linked to an 18.1% decrease in mortality after 6 months and a 16.8% decrease after 12 months. Additionally, a 10-percentage-point rise in booster vaccination rates correlated with a 33.1% reduction in COVID-19 mortality.\r\n\r\nGiven that no scientific study was released that proved \"that the higher a country's vaccination rate, the higher the excess deaths,\" we have rated this claim as False.",

        "original_reasoning_text": "The rumor emerged after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a \"Risk Assessment Summary for SARS CoV-2 Sublineage BA.2.86\" on Aug. 23, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the summary explained what variants of viruses are with regard to a new one identified in several countries the previous week:\r\n\r\nAll viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), change over time. These viruses with changes are called \"variants.\"  These changes can affect how contagious a virus is, how well it responds to treatment, and how severely it affects people. Last week, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 called BA.2.86 was detected in samples from people in Denmark and Israel. At least two cases have been identified in the United States. This variant is notable because it has multiple genetic differences from previous versions of SARS-CoV-2.\r\n\r\nIt was the \"Current Risk Assesment\" section of the document that sparked discussion on social media (emphasis ours):\r\n\r\nBased on what CDC knows now, existing tests used to detect and medications used to treat COVID-19 appear to be effective with this variant. BA.2.86 may be more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines. Scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of the forthcoming, updated COVID-19 vaccine. CDC's current assessment is that this updated vaccine will be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization. \r\n\r\nThe sentence about the new variant being \"more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines\" did not compare vaccinated individuals to the unvaccinated. The summary stated that those who had previously been infected or vaccinated may be more susceptible to this variant compared to previous variants.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the document, the CDC explained that the mutations could impact the immunity derived from vaccines compared with other variants (emphasis ours):\r\n\r\n    The large number of mutations in this variant raises concerns of greater escape from existing immunity from vaccines and previous infections compared with other recent variants. For example, one analysis of mutations suggests the difference may be as large as or greater than that between BA.2 and XBB.1.5, which circulated nearly a year apart. However, virus samples are not yet broadly available for more reliable laboratory testing of antibodies, and it is too soon to know the real-world impacts on immunity. Nearly all the U.S. population has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from vaccination, previous infection, or both, and it is likely that these antibodies will continue to provide some protection against severe disease from this variant. This is an area of ongoing scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nGiven that the CDC had not stated that individuals who had received the COVID-19 vaccine were more susceptible to the new variant than those who had not been vaccinated, we have rated this claim as \"False.\"",
