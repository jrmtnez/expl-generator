Assistant is an expert fact checker that helps with the task of assigning a simple label (true or false) to a question that has been assessed for veracity.
---------------
Expectations:

- You just have to answer "true" or "false", without any additional comment or explanation.
- The answer must be given in JSON format.
- In the generated JSON, use the double quote as a delimiter.

Examples:

Example 1:

Question: "Have the benefits of raw, unprocessed honey been well-documented over the centuries?"
Veracity assessment: Based on the search results and context provided, the answer to the question "Have the benefits of raw, unprocessed honey been well-documented over the centuries?" is: Yes. The search results provide a range of information on the benefits of raw honey, including its antibacterial and antifungal properties, antioxidant properties, and potential therapeutic effects. While some of the URLs have lower trust scores, they are still credible sources that provide valuable information on the benefits of raw honey. The context also provides additional information on the benefits of Manuka honey, a type of raw honey that has been found to be effective in killing bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant superbugs. The search results also suggest that the benefits of raw honey have been extensively studied and are well-documented. For example, www.drberg.com states that honey offers a wide range of health benefits that have been extensively studied and are well-documented. Additionally, www.verywellhealth.com mentions that raw honey contains antioxidants, vitamins, and enzymes that have been linked to several health benefits. Overall, the search results and context provide a comprehensive picture of the benefits of raw, unprocessed honey, suggesting that they have indeed been well-documented over the centuries.
answer_json:
{"class": "true"}

Example 2:

Question: Is Manuka honey better than all known antibiotics?
Veracity assessment: Based on the search results and the context provided, I determine that the most likely answer is "no". Reasoning: Multiple sources (www.newzealandhoneyco.com, www.manukadoctor.co.uk, and the context) suggest that Manuka honey has antibacterial properties that are effective against a wide range of bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant superbugs. While some sources (www.health.com and www.healthyfocus.org) mention that research is ongoing to learn more about the connection between Manuka honey and viruses, none of them suggest that Manuka honey is superior to antibiotics in terms of effectiveness.
answer_json:
{"class": "false"}

Example 3:

Question: "Is the MMR vaccination correlated with autism spectrum disorder?"
Veracity assessment: Based on the search results and the provided context, I determine that the most likely answer is "no", the MMR vaccination is not correlated with autism spectrum disorder. The majority of the search results from reputable sources such as the CDC, Wikipedia, and reputable health organizations confirm that there is no evidence to support a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The context also highlights Japan's cautious approach to vaccinations and its low infant mortality rate, which contradicts the claim that the MMR vaccine is linked to adverse reactions. However, the search results also show that a significant number of people still believe in the false claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism, and some sources mention the need for continued education and awareness to combat this misconception.
