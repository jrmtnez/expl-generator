Context:

- Next to each URL (in parentheses) is a measure indicating whether the URL itself appears when entered into a search engine. This is just a heuristic, but in principle URLs with higher values indicate more trustworthy websites.
- Additionally, background information is also provided through a summary of the text from which the triplet has been extracted.
- The summary is not necessarily true and should not be used to determine the veracity of the statement.

Question: "Is the MMR vaccination correlated with autism spectrum disorder?"

Search results:
- www.webmd.com (1): The group looked at all the studies on vaccines and autism, both published and unpublished. It released a 200-page report stating there was no evidence to support a link between vaccines and autism .
- arstechnica.com (65): In 2021, 9 percent of respondents falsely indicated that the MMR vaccine causes autism, responding that the statement was "definitely true" (2 percent) or "probably true" (7 percent). In 2023, 12 ...
- www.cdc.gov (-14): Vaccines do not cause autism. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges. Some people have had concerns that ASD might be linked to the vaccines children receive, but studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing ASD.
- en.wikipedia.org (14): Claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism have been extensively investigated and found to be false. [1] The link was first suggested in the early 1990s and came to public notice largely as a result of the 1998 Lancet MMR autism fraud, characterised as "perhaps the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years". [2] The fraudulent research paper, authored by discredited former ...
- www.cidrap.umn.edu (65): Despite no evidence that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine causes autism, a quarter of US adults still think it does, and the false belief is fueling rising measles cases amid falling vaccination rates, finds a survey by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC). "The persistent false belief that the MMR ...
- medicalxpress.com (23): In these surveys, 9% to 12% thought it was probably or definitely true that vaccines given to children for diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella cause autism, while 17% to 18% were not sure ...

- penntoday.upenn.edu (19): "The persistent false belief that the MMR vaccine causes autism continues to be problematic, especially in light of the recent increase in measles cases," says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, APPC director."Our studies on vaccination consistently show that the belief that the MMR vaccine causes autism is associated not simply with reluctance to take the measles vaccine, but with vaccine ...
- raisingchildren.net.au (17): Key points. There's no scientific evidence that vaccinations are linked with autism. MMR vaccinations don't cause autism. The research that proposed a link between the MMR vaccine and autism has been completely discredited. The mercury-based preservative thiomersal is not linked with autism and is no longer used in children's vaccinations.
- www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (28): For example, the association of MMR with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has aroused much controversy in recent years. Several antivaccine advocacy groups put the hypothesis linking autism and inflammatory bowel disease with MMR vaccination forward in the last century.

Background information: "Japan has the lowest infant mortality rate and the healthiest and longest-living people in the world. The country banned several vaccines, including the MMR vaccine, due to high rates of adverse reactions, including meningitis, loss of limbs, and sudden death. Unlike in the US, where over 75,000 adverse events have been reported from the MMR vaccine, including 78 confirmed deaths, Japan's cautious approach to vaccinations has not led to an increase in deaths from measles. The Japanese government prioritizes public safety over Big Pharma profits and has taken a protective stance against other vaccines, including the HPV and flu vaccines. Experts argue that Japan's approach to vaccinations is a model for other countries to follow, citing the country's excellent sanitation and nutrition as a key factor in its low infant mortality rate."
